> **二、听课建议(标准操作，可以训练)**
>
> 1.完整听懂理论课(2-3遍，并认真做笔记，理清思路)
> 2.通过做题来熟练方法，做题一定要篇为最小单位
>
> 3.每道题必须用尽可能多的角度思考做题
>
> 4.每20篇一个单元，总结反思升华!(认识，实践，再认识，再实践)
>
> **三、刷题建议：四遍刷题法**
>
> **1.第一遍：限时做。**做全套题需180分钟做完
> **(4篇阅读必须80分钟)**第一遍限时做完，千万**不要自**
> **己对答案，**一定要让你的朋友对，只知道结果，不知道哪道题对错!
>
> ·**限时做的好处：模拟临考状态，有时间压力有心理压力，能全面暴露问题**!
>
> **2.第二遍：不限时做。**在做第二遍做时，不限时"慢镜头效应",把每个点都思考充分，让我们的能
> 力达到极限!
>
> **3.第三遍：带着痛点听斌斌老师讲一遍。**弄清楚每一个问题；反复出现的错题，精准训练，彻底扫清
> 每个死角。**然后做模考笔记，**写出来会让人思维更缜密。
>
> **4.第四遍：给别人讲一遍(或者自己讲给自己听)**。在讲给别人的过程中，能使自己的解题思路更清晰，
> 更透彻；别人如果听爽了，那说明你彻底理解了!
>
> **四**
> **、复盘建议：过程分析，而非传统复盘方法------分析答案对错的原因**
>
> 过程分析(假如**答案是B,**而 你选择了A )
>
> 1.把你从拿上题到选出A的整个思考过程写出来
>
> 2\. 反思：如果当时我把上面过程中哪个环节改一下，我也就可以选出B
>
> 3.反问：我为什么第一遍时没这么做呢?我是违背了斌斌老师讲过的哪个原理呢?

>
> **(一)阅读的传统定位方法**
>
> 1.先看题干，从题干中找定位词：大写字母/专有名词/数字/人名/地名/关键词
> 2.带着这些定位词到原文中去定 位，找到出题句。
>
> 3.精读出题句，对比选项看有没有同义词替换或同义改写。
> 4.如果没有答案，就去看上一句或下一句，最多三句。

> 当一个选项定位点都对时，该选项不一定正确，这时可以再结合排除法锁定正确选项。
