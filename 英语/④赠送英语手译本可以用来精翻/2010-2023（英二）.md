> **一、例证题**
>
> 1.常见题干标志：example ，case ，illustrate ，demonstrate ，to show
> ，by citing（为了) 2.解题方法：
>
> （1）例子本身不重要，重要的是例子所支持的观点
>
> （2）先定位到例子出现的位置，然后再找观点，观点往往在例子前（假设定位点在第二段第三
> 行，答案往往在定位点之前找），不过有时也在例子后，也可以在不同的段落
>
> 3.干扰选项:

（1）就事论事，谈论例子本身，而不是例子所支持的观点 4.例证题小技巧:

> （1）互为相反的选项往往有一个正确答案
>
> （2）文章中若出现情态动词: must ，can ，could ，may ，might ，should
> ，would ，ought to ，往往 表达了作者观点或者态度
>
> **二、词汇题**
>
> 1.常见题干标志：" "、 "(Line .paragraph ) 、most probably means
>
> 2.解题方法：
>
> （1）逻辑关系------通过定位好的句子，根据逻辑关系找同义词或反义词
>
> ①句子1=句子2 ，找近义词------分号（;）表示前后两句话表达意思相同
>
> ②句子1, but句子2 ，找反义词
>
> ③根据感情色彩判断，感情色彩代表作者态度大方向
>
> （2）简单词，考查熟词僻义，排除表面含义，不断提炼内涵
>
> （3）反复强调的是重点
>
> 3.干扰选项特征:字面意思理解
>
> **三、推理题**
>
> 1.常见题干标志： infer ，learn from ，imply ，suggest ，conclude
>
> 2.解题方法：
>
> （1）不要过分主观推测，原文可以找到的内容往往即是正确答案
>
> （2）推理题的答案多在转折处
>
> （3）排除绝对化，选择语气缓和的，比如may
>
> （4）注意同义改写------常出细节题、中心思想题、推理题
>
> **四、态度题**
>
> 1.常见题干标志：attitude ，deem ，consider ，tone 2.解题方法：
>
> （1）选项词归纳
>
> ①正面态度：positive ，optimistic ，approval ，supportive
>
> ②负面态度：negative(消极的), pessimistic(悲观的), disapproval,
> critical(重要的，批评的)， doubtful(怀疑的) ，suspicious
> ，skeptical,questionable
>
> ③中立态度：neutral ，objective ，impartial ，disinterested（中立的）
>
> （2）当作者的态度没有明确提出时:
>
> ①首尾句串读法，梳理文章的框架，来推测作者态度
>
> ②文章中的adj（表示评价）\\adv往往是作者的态度
>
> ③转折处、情态动词之后

>
> 3.态度题小技巧之小墓碑选项------看到直接排除
>
> （1）漠不关心的：uninterested ，indifferent ，unconcerned
>
> （2）偏见的：contemptuous ，prejudice ， biased
>
> （3）困惑的：subjective ，puzzled ，confused
>
> **五、细节题**
>
> 1.常见题干标志：What /how/why/ because/ in that/as等＋具体信息，
>
> 即为什么？怎么样？是什么？

2.解题方法：

> （1）定位！细节题的关键在于定位，题干的相关信息可能直接在文章中出现（也可能进行某种
> 程度上的改写），这种情况下，细节题定位到的地方，往往就是题目对应的答案，不过有时也
> 得需要结合定位地方的上下句。
>
> （2）细节服从主旨！，与中心主旨越接近的选项，往往越有可能是正确的
> 3.细节题中的因果题
>
> （1）常见因果关系词------because,since,for,as
>
> （2）方法------ 前后相同的逻辑，优先考虑因果关系
>
> 当一个现象具有多个成因，考察主要原因时，那么次要原因就是干扰选项
>
> **六、中心思想题（主旨题）**
>
> 1.常见题干标志： mainly about ，discuss ，the best title/subject
> ，appropriate title ，main idea

2.解题方法：

> （1）首尾句串读法------将各段首末句串联成一个整体，注意转折处，此方法较普遍使用
>
> （2）中心句法
>
> ①开头问句------一般在回答中包含着文章的重点信息，也就是中心思想
>
> ②独句段------即一句话单独构成一个段落，独句段通常与全文的主旨密切相关
>
> （3）中心词法
>
> ①注意文章反复出现的高频词，以及对该高频词的同义改写
>
> ②可以在全文范围找，也可在首尾句中找
>
> ③一篇文章的中心词可能不止一个，中心思想题的答案应该包括全部的中心词，而不是仅
> 包含一个，这样的选项比较片面
>
> 3.常见干扰项
>
> （1）某个答案范围过大，或者范围过小------可能只是文章某段的主旨
>
> （2）做题要客观，路见不平一定不要拔刀相助！文章怎样就怎样！
>
> （3）少数派原则，作者往往站在少数人观点的一方，因为作者关注的方面往往是多数人没有关
> 注到的。
>
> **附录1：阅读题解题的大方向技巧与思想**

> （1）串联题干信息，把握文章主题。明确
>
> （2）注意句子与句子(好与坏），段落之间的联系
>

>
> 关于阅读手译，下面学长以一问一答的形式和大家讲解关于如何做考研英语手译的。在文
> 章之前先和大家说明几点，第一，由于考研试卷反作弊的"花卷"处理机制，即考生前后左右
> 座位分发的试卷的选项顺序都是不同的，也就是说存在多个版本的真题，它们选项内容一样，但
> 是顺序被打乱了。如果这份资料的题目选项顺序和别的版本试卷的题目选项顺序不一样，这是
> 正常现象，不必担心。第二，千万要记得在分析真题的时候，动脑最重要！任何事情都无法替
> 代思考本身！
>
> **一.英语阅读真题需要手译吗？**
>
> 先直接说回答：需要！原因如下
>
> （1）首先是阅读部分的分值占比很大，无论是英一还是英二，足足都有40分，而阅读水平
> 的提高也必将带动其他题型的提高，"得阅读者得天下
> "这句话不是白讲的，所以前中期花大 量精力在阅读上是必须的。
>
> （2）而备考阅读，最重要的不是做（即反复的看文章、做题目），而是分析和总结阅读，
> 将文章内的单词、长难句、题型设置原则等搞清楚。而手译则正是分析和总结阅读的过程，很
> 多人关于手译存在这么一种看法：他们认为手译就是单纯的把文章翻译一遍，其实这种观点是
> 错误的。科学的手译绝对不是简简单单的翻译文章，而是一种分析和总结阅读的过程和工具，
> 在这个过程中，手译会显著的提高你的英语能力。
>
> （3）笔者在考研的时候，曾经花了三个月时间把近20年的阅读真题都手译了一遍，确实，
> 过程很痛苦，但是手译完了之后，我可以很明显发现我的英语能力有了显著的提高，在手译最
> 后的半个月，整个手译过程会变得越来越轻松。
>
> **二、分析阅读真题要分析哪些内容？**
>
> 对于一篇阅读真题来说，可以简单的分为两大部分：正文、题目，我们需要庖丁解牛似的
> 对这两部分进行拆解
>
> **1.对正文的分析和总结**------可以提高英语基础能力
>
> （1）单词、短语：找出句子中不认识的单词（以及熟词僻义等）、短语并记录
>
> （2）句子（长难句）：学会去拆分句子、分析句子成分，判断相近句子之间的逻辑关系
>
> （3）文章结构：分析文章整体的行文思路、段落结构，以一个统筹的视角，可以有效提高把
> 握文章的能力，这部分黄皮书、考研真相每篇真题前都有相关的文章结构解读，大家可以参考。
>
> **2.对题目的分析和总结**------可以提高技巧解题能力

> （2）学会定位到题干信息（注意题干的同义替换形式）在原文中的位置，找出答案。题目设
> 置一般都很有规律，比如第二题答案在原文中的位置一定是在第一题答案原文位置之后，而且

>
> （3）分析错误选项，学会大致分析每一个错误选项的干扰方式

> **四、整个手译的练习流程？**
>
> 结合我的复习经验以及手译本的排版，制定了如下的手译训练流程，经过去年很多21届考
> 生的亲身使用，效果很好。（注意：电子版和纸质版排版有局部差别，更适合平板复习）
>
> 5
>
> **步骤1：**做题------给自己15分钟的时间，模拟在考试状态下做题的状态
>
> （1）建议先看题干（不要看选项，不然易干扰思维、浪费时间
> ）了解文章大致主旨，然后 再看文章，最后做题
>
> （2）过程中一定不要查单词，文章再难，也一定要忍住！！！
> 目的就是习惯这种考试感觉。 **步骤2：**全文逐句手译
>
> （1）遇到结构简单、句内单词都认识、一眼可以看懂的句子------直接过掉
>
> （2）遇到复杂句子，长难句
>
> ①圈出不认识的单词、短语------记录在单词本上，并查词典，做笔记，吃透！！！

②解析句子------学会划分句子主干，基础比较差的，前期可以参考解析书将一个句子细
致按照主谓宾定状补来分割，理解句子成分，打一下基础

> ③翻译全文------不要追求翻译多么得体，多么精确，翻译到自己可以理解的程度就可以
> 了，这是阅读题，不是翻译题，翻译题有自己的训练方法
>
> ④修订翻译------对翻译的内容进行核对与修订，并进行反思
> **步骤3：**重做题目
>
> （1）在解析过全文之后，重做题目，这时候的准确率会大幅度上升
>
> ①判断题目所属的题型
>
> ②定位到题干信息（注意题干的同义替换形式）在原文中的位置，如此题可定位到第xxx
> 段第 xxx句，可同义替换为 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 。

①对错误选项的干扰形式进行总结分析，如无中生有、反向干扰、偷换概念，可以参考
黄皮书等参考资料

（4 ）This practice was justified by the claim that women were needed at
home, and it kept juries unrepresentative of women through the 1960s.

（3）Then it presents that connection, even among two-year-olds, between
girls as not only innocent but as evidence of innocence.

（3）I assumed that phase was something experts developed after years of
research into children's behaviour: wrong.

（3）The research of Till Von Wachter, the economist at Columbia
University, suggests that not all people graduating into a recession see
their life chances dimmed: those with degrees from elite universities

left behind.

> （1）In an essay entitled "Making It in America," the author Adam
> Davidson relates a joke from cotton country about just how much a
> modern textile mill has been automated: The average mill has only two
> employees today, "a man and a dog.

（2）The man is there to feed the dog, and the dog is there to keep the
man away from the machines."

> **【第二段】**

（1）★Davidson's article is one of a number of pieces that have recently
appeared making the point that the reason we have such stubbornly high
unemployment and declining middle-class incomes today is largely because
of the big drop in demand because of the Great Recession, but it is also
because of the advances in both globalization and the information
technology revolution, which are more rapidly than ever replacing labor
with machines or foreign workers.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| > （3）As Davidson notes, "In the 10 years ending in 2009, \[U.S.\]   |
| > factories shed workers so fast that they erased almost all the      |
| > gains of the previous 70 years; roughly one out of every three      |
| > manufacturing jobs---about 6 million in total---disappeared."       |

> （1 ） ★In a world where average is officially over, there are many

（1）Do we need quotas to ensure that women can continue to climb the
corporate ladder fairly as they balance work and family?

（1）After all, four decades of evidence has now shown that corporations
in Europe as well as the US are evading the meritocratic hiring and
promotion of women to top positions---no matter how much "soft pressure"
is put upon them.

（1）This slim volume is packed with tips to help wage slaves as well as
lottery winners get the most "happiness bang for your buck."

> less of it watching television (something the average American spends
> a whopping two months a year doing, and is hardly jollier for it).

> （3）Buying gifts or giving to charity is often more pleasurable than

（ 1 ）But the article is actually quite optimistic, as it outlines a
potential solution to this problem, suggesting that an approach (which
involves a one-hour, next-to-no-cost program) can close 63 percent of
the achievement gap (measured by such factors as grades) between
first-generation and other students.

（1）We know the difference between voluntary and involuntary part-time
employment because people tell us.

> （3）If the answer is "yes," they are classified as working part-time.

（1）The Flatiron School, where people pay to learn programming, started
as one of the many coding bootcamps that's become popular for adults
looking for a career change.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| （2）★ Thinking of time as a resource to be maximised means you       |
| approach it instrumentally, judging any given moment as well spent    |
| only in so far as it advances progress toward some goal.              |

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| （3）You 'd think this might fuel the efficiency mind-set, but in     |
| fact, Eberle notes, such ritualistic behaviour helps us "step outside |
| time's flow" into "soul time."                                        |

（5）"Carry a book with you at all times" can actually work,
too---providing you dip in often enough, so that reading becomes the
default state from which you temporarily surface to take care of
business, before dropping back down.

（1）Young people who are still getting started in life were more likely
than older adults to prioritize personal fulfillment in their work, to
believe they will advance their careers most by regularly changing jobs,
to favor communities with more public services and a faster pace of
life, to agree that couples should be financially secure before getting
married or having children, and to maintain that children are best
served by two parents working outside the home, the survey found.

（1）Radesky has studied the use of mobile phones and tablets at
mealtimes by giving mother--child pairs a food-testing exercise.

（4） "Parents don't have to be exquisitely present at all times, but
there needs to be a balance and parents need to be responsive and
sensitive to a child's verbal or nonverbal expressions of an emotional
need," says Radesky.

（1）On the other hand, Tronick himself is concerned that the worries
about kids ' use of screens are born out of an "oppressive ideology that
demands that parents should always be interacting" with their children:
"It's based on a somewhat fantasised, very white, very
upper-middle-class ideology that says if you're failing to expose your
child to 30,000 words you are neglecting them."

（2）★Tronick believes that just because a child isn't learning from the
screen doesn't mean there's no value to it---particularly if it gives
parents time to have a shower, do housework or simply have a break from
their child.

（4）In March, for the first time, wind and solar power accounted for
more than 10 percent of the power generated in the US, reported the US
Energy Information Administration.

（3）But that message did not play well with many in Iowa, where wind
turbines dot the fields and provide 36 percent of the state's
electricity generation---and where tech giants like Microsoft are being
attracted by the availability of clean energy to power their data
centers.

（1）The question "what happens when the wind doesn't blow or the sun
doesn't shine?" has provided a quick put-down for skeptics.

（1）★The power and ambition of the giants of the digital economy is
astonishing---Amazon has just announced the purchase of the upmarket
grocery chain Whole Foods for \$13.5bn, but two years ago Facebook paid
even more than that to acquire the WhatsApp messaging service, which
doesn't have any physical product at all.

> （ 2 ） What WhatsApp offered Facebook was an intricate and finely
> detailed web of its users ' friendships and social lives.

> （1）Facebook promised the European commission then that it would not
> link phone numbers to Facebook identities, but it broke the promise
> almost as soon as the deal went through.

> who sent them and to whom was enormously revealing and still could be.

>
> （4）It may be that the value of Whole Foods to Amazon is not so much
> the 460 shops it owns, but the records of which customers have

> （1）Competition law appears to be the only way to address these

> power.

（1）The state's proposed Forest Carbon Plan aims to double efforts to
thin out young trees and clear brush in parts of the forest.

（1）My concern with leaving it up to the individual, however, is our
limited sense of what needs to be achieved.

（ 1 ） ★ While the conversation around our environment and our
responsibility toward it remains centered on shopping bags and straws,
we're ignoring the balance of power that implies that as "consumers" we
must shop sustainably, rather than as "citizens" hold our governments
and industries to account to push for real systemic change.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| > （3 ）In her latest book, *Why Good People Do Bad Environmental     |

（1）This might mean implementing policy such as a plastic tax that adds
a cost to environmentally problematic action, or banning single-use
plastics altogether.

> （1）Rats and other animals need to be highly attuned to social
> signals from others so they can identify friends to cooperate with and
> enemies to avoid.
>
> （2）To find out if this extends to non-living beings, Laleh Quinn at
> the University of California, San Diego, and her colleagues tested
> whether rats can detect social signals from robotic rats.
>
> **【第二段】**
>
> （1）They housed eight adult rats with two types of robotic rat---one
> social and one asocial---for four days.
>
> （2）The robot rats were quite minimalist, resembling a chunkier
> version of a computer mouse with wheels-to move around and colorful
> markings.
>
> **【第三段】**
>
> （1）During the experiment, the social robot rat followed the living
> rats around, played with the same toys, and opened cage doors to let
> trapped rats escape.
>
> （2）Meanwhile, the asocial robot simply moved forwards and backwards
> and side to side.
>

> **【第四段】**
>
> （1）Next, the researchers trapped the robots in cages and gave the
> rats the opportunity to release them by pressing a lever.
>
> （2）Across 18 trials each, the living rats were 52 percent more
> likely on average to set the social robot free than the asocial one.
>
> （3）This suggests that the rats perceived the social robot as a
> genuine social being.
>
> （4）They may have bonded more with the social robot because it
> displayed behaviours like communal exploring and playing.
>
> （5）This could lead to the rats better remembering having freed it
> earlier, and wanting the robot to return the favour when they get
> trapped, says Quinn
>
> **【第五段】**
>
> （1）"Rats have been shown to engage in multiple forms of reciprocal
> help and cooperation, including what is referred to as direct
> reciprocity where a rat will help another rat that has previously
> helped them," says Quinn.

（3）It 's not popular to say. but one reason their pay has gone up so
much is that CEOs really have upped their game relative to many other
workers in the U.S. economy.

（1）Furthermore, the highest CEO salaries are paid to outside
candidates, not to the cozy insider picks, another sign that high CEO
pay is not some kind of depredation at the expense of the rest of the
company.

（1）Schwitzgebel predicted the intervention would have no effect;he had
previously found that ethics professors do not differ from other
professors on a range of behaviors ，including voting rates， blood
donation and returning library books.

（1）In a very practical way ，the Internet is becoming an external hard
drive for our memories ，a process known as\"" cognitive offloading."
