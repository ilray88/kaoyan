> **二、词汇题**
>
> 1.常见题干标志：" "、 "(Line .paragraph ) 、most probably means

1.常见题干标志：What /how/why/ because/ in
that/as等＋具体信息，即为什么？怎么样？是什么？ 2.解题方法：

>
> （1）常见因果关系词------because,since,for,as

>
> **六、中心思想题（主旨题）**
>
> 1.常见题干标志： mainly about ，discuss ，the best title/subject
> ，appropriate title ，main idea

2.解题方法：

> （1）首尾句串读法------将各段首末句串联成一个整体，注意转折处，此方法较普遍使用
>
> （2）中心句法
>
> ①开头问句------一般在回答中包含着文章的重点信息，也就是中心思想
>
> ②独句段------即一句话单独构成一个段落，独句段通常与全文的主旨密切相关
>
> （3）中心词法
>
> ①注意文章反复出现的高频词，以及对该高频词的同义改写
>
> ②可以在全文范围找，也可在首尾句中找
>
> ③一篇文章的中心词可能不止一个，中心思想题的答案应该包括全部的中心词，而不是仅
> 包含一个，这样的选项比较片面
>
> 3.常见干扰项
>
> （1）某个答案范围过大，或者范围过小------可能只是文章某段的主旨
>
> （2）做题要客观，路见不平一定不要拔刀相助！文章怎样就怎样！
>
> （3）少数派原则，作者往往站在少数人观点的一方，因为作者关注的方面往往是多数人没有关

represented worthwhile research in their own right; but, in the
twentieth century, local studies have increasingly become acceptable to
professionals only if they incorporate, and reflect on, the wider
geological picture.

（2 ） ★As the Internet becomes more and more commercialized, it is in
the interest of business to universalize access-after all, the more
people online, the more potential customers there are.

（2 ） ★ I have been transformed from a passionate advocate of the
philosophy of "having it all", preached by Linda Kelsey for the past
seven years in the pages of She magazine, into a woman who is happy to
settle for a bit of everything.

（ 1 ） ★ Here is an example, which I heard at a nurses ' convention, of
a story which works well because the audience all shared the same view
of doctors.

（1 ） ★If you are part of the group which you are addressing, you will
be in a position to know the experiences and problems which are common
to all of you and it'll be appropriate for you to make a passing remark
about the inedible canteen food or the chairman's notorious bad taste in
ties.

> （2）★With other audiences you mustn't attempt to cut in with humor as
> they will resent an outsider making disparaging remarks about their
> canteen or their chairman.
>
> （3 ）You will be on safer ground if you stick to scapegoats like the
> Post Office or the telephone system.

> （1）If you feel awkward being humorous, you must practice so that it
> becomes more natural.

（2） Include a few casual and apparently off-the-cuff remarks which you
can deliver in a relaxed and unforced manner.

> 30

> （3）★Often it's the delivery which causes the audience to smile, so
> speak slowly and remember that a raised eyebrow or an unbelieving look
> may help to show that you are making a light-hearted remark.
>
> **【第五段】**
>
> （1）Look for the humor. It often comes from the unexpected.
>
> （2）A twist on a familiar quote "If at first you don't succeed, give
> up" or a play on words or on a situation.
>
> （3）Search for exaggeration and understatements.
>
> （4）Look at your talk and pick out a few words or sentences which you
> can turn about and inject with humor.

> （2）Our factories hum to the rhythm of robot assembly arms.

> （3）Our banking is done at automated teller terminals that thank us
> with mechanical politeness for the transaction.

> （4）Our subway trains are controlled by tireless robot-drivers.

> （5 ） ★And thanks to the continual miniaturization of electronics and

（3） ★But the human mind can glimpse a rapidly changing scene and
immediately disregard the 98 percent that is irrelevant, instantaneously
focusing on the monkey at the side of a winding forest road or the
single suspicious face in a big crowd.

（2）Since OPEC agreed to supply-cuts in March, the price of crude oil
has jumped to almost \$26 a barrel, up from less than \$10 last
December.

> （3 ） ★This near-tripling of oil prices calls up scary memories of
> the 1973 oil shock, when prices quadrupled, and 1979-1980, when they
> also almost tripled.

> （4）Both previous shocks resulted in double-digit inflation and

（3）In Europe, taxes account for up to four-fifths of the retail price,
so even quite big changes in the price of crude have a more muted effect
on pump prices than in the past.

>
> （3）Software, consultancy and mobile telephones use far less oil than
> steel or car production.
>
> （4）For each dollar of GDP (in constant prices) rich economies now
> use nearly 50% less oil than in 1973.

> （5）★The OECD estimates in its latest Economic Outlook that, if oil

> 39

（1）Just three weeks before the Court's ruling on physician-assisted
suicide, the National Academy of Science (NAS) released a two-volume
report, *Approaching Death: Improving Care at the End of Life*.

> （2）It identifies the undertreatment of pain and the

> procedures that may prolong and even dishonor the period of dying" as
> the twin problems of end-of-life care.

> （1）The profession is taking steps to require young doctors to train

> therapies, to develop a Medicare billing code for hospital-based care,
> and to develop new standards for assessing and treating pain at the
> end of life.

> （1）The latest revolution isn't simply a matter of gentlemen reading

>
> （2）That kind of electronic spying has been going on for decades.

（3 ）In the past three or four years, the World Wide Web has given
birth to a whole industry of point-and-click spying.

> （4）The spooks call it "open source intelligence," and as the Net
> grows, it is becoming increasingly influential.
>
> （5）In 1995 the CIA held a contest to see who could compile the most

>
> **【第三段】**

> （ 1 ） ★Among the firms [making the biggest splash]{.underline} in

>
> （2）★Straitford makes money by selling the results of spying
> (covering nations from Chile to Russia) to corporations like
> energy-services firm McDermott International.
>
> 48
>
> （3）Many of its predictions are available online at
> *www.straitford.com.*
>
> **【第四段】**
>
> （ 1 ） Straitford president George Friedman says he sees the online
> world as a kind of mutually reinforcing tool for both information
> collection and distribution, a spymaster's dream.

（2 ）Last week his firm was busy vacuuming up data bits from the far
corners of the world and predicting a crisis in Ukraine.

> （3） "As soon as that report runs, we'll suddenly get 500 new
> internet sign-ups from Ukraine," says Friedman, a former political
> science professor.
>
> （4）"And we'll hear back from some of them."
>
> （ 5 ） Open-source spying does have its risks, of course, since it
> can be difficult to tell good information from bad. That's where
> Straitford earns its keep.

（3）Next year, after a series of mergers is completed, just four
railroads will control well over 90 percent of all the freight moved by
major rail carriers

（3）It\'s theory to which many economists subscribe, but in practice it
often leaves railroads in the position of determining which companies
will flourish and which will fail.

（2）★We all understand that at some level, yet as medical consumers we
treat death as a problem to be solved.

（3 ） ★ Shielded by third-party payers from the cost of our care, we
demand everything that can possibly be done for us, even if it's
useless.

（5） ★Physicians---frustrated by their inability to cure the disease
and fearing loss of hope in the patient---too often offer aggressive
treatment far beyond what is scientifically justified.

> （2）Less well known is the advantage that Adam Abbott has in life

> （ 2 ） Even more striking, six of the seven heads of government of

> really uses Japanese characters.
>

> **【第五段】**

> （1）The humiliation continues.

> （2）At university graduation ceremonies, the ABCs proudly get their

（1）Ralph Waldo Emerson and other Transcendentalist philosophers
thought schooling and rigorous book learning put unnatural restraints on
children: "We are shut up in schools and college recitation rooms for 10
or 15 years and come out at last with a bellyful of words and do not
know a thing."

> （2）Mark Twain\'s *Huckleberry Finn* exemplified American
> anti-intellectualism.
>
> （3 ）Its hero avoids being civilized---going to school and learning
> to read---so he can preserve his innate goodness.

> **【第六段】**

> （2）Intellect is the critical, creative, and contemplative side of
> the mind.
>
> 82
>
> （3）Intelligence seeks to grasp, manipulate, re-order, and adjust,
> while intellect examines, ponders, wonders, theorizes, criticizes, and
> imagines.
>
> **【第七段】**
>
> （1）School remains a place where intellect is mistrusted.
>
> （2 ）Hofstadter says our country\'s educational system is in the
> grips of people who "joyfully and militantly proclaim their hostility
> to intellect and their eagerness to identify with children who show
> the least intellectual promise."

> **【第四段】**
>
> （1 ） Illustrated with an entertaining array of examples from both

> unmistakable.
>
> （2）But it is less clear, to take the question of his subtitle, why

> （4）He is not arguing, as many do, that we can no longer think

> （1）Russians have a deep love for their own language and carry large

（2） There is the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), which presents
superb productions of the plays at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre on
the Avon.

> （3）And there are the townsfolk who largely live off the tourists who
> come, not to see the plays, but to look at Anne Hathaway's Cottage,
> Shakespeare's birthplace and the other sights.

> （1）The worthy residents of Stratford doubt that the theatre adds a
> penny to their revenue.
>
> （2）They frankly dislike the RSC's actors, them with their long hair
> and beards and sandals and noisiness.

> （3）★ It's all deliciously ironic when you consider that Shakespeare,
> who earns their living, was himself an actor (with a beard) and did
> his share of noise-making.

（4） ★That means a higher proportion of what is in the sea is being
caught, so the real difference between present and past is likely to be
worse than the one recorded by changes in catch sizes.

（6 ）Some individuals would therefore not have been caught, since no
baited hooks would have been available to trap them, leading to an
underestimate of fish stocks in the past.

（2） They believe the data support an idea current among marine

（ 2 ） If you then examined the European national youth teams that feed
the World Cup and professional ranks, you would find this strange
phenomenon to be even more pronounced.

（ 1 ）Anders Ericsson, a 58-year-old psychology professor at Florida
State University, says he believes strongly in "none of the above."

（3）And the best way to learn how to encode information meaningfully,
Ericsson determined, was a process known as deliberate practice.

（1 ）Ericsson and his colleagues have thus taken to studying expert
performers in a wide range of pursuits, including soccer.

> （2）They gather all the data they can, not just performance
> statistics and biographical details but also the results of their own
> laboratory experiments with high achievers.

（4 ）Or, put another way, expert performers---whether in memory or
surgery, ballet or computer programming---are nearly always made, not
born.

> （1 ）For the past several years, the Sunday newspaper supplement
> *Parade* has featured a column called "Ask Marilyn."
>
> 127
>
> （2） People are invited to query Marilyn vos Savant, who at age 10
> had tested at a mental level of someone about 23 years old; that gave
> her an IQ of 228---the highest score ever recorded.
>
> （3）IQ tests ask you to complete verbal and visual analogies, to
> envision paper after it has been folded and cut, and to deduce
> numerical sequences, among other similar tasks.
>
> （4）★So it is a bit confusing when vos Savant fields such queries
> from the average Joe (whose IQ is 100) as, What's the difference
> between love and fondness? Or what is the nature of luck and
> coincidence?
>
> （5） ★ It's not obvious how the capacity to visualize objects and to
> figure out numerical patterns suits one to answer questions that have
> eluded some of the best poets and philosophers.
>
> **【第二段】**
>
> （1）Clearly, intelligence encompasses more than a score on a test.
>
> （2）Just what does it mean to be smart?
>
> （ 3 ） How much of intelligence can be specified, and how much can we
> learn about it from neurology, genetics, computer science and other
> fields?
>
> 128
>
> **【第三段】**
>
> （1）The defining term of intelligence in humans still seems to be the
> IQ score, even though IQ tests are not given as often as they used to
> be.
>
> （2）The test comes primarily in two forms: the Stanford-Binet
> Intelligence Scale and the Wechsler Intelligence Scales (both come in
> adult and children's version).
>
> （ 3 ） Generally costing several hundred dollars, they are usually
> given only by psychologists, although variations of them populate
> bookstores and the World Wide Web.
>
> （4） Superhigh scores like vos Savant's are no longer possible,
> because scoring is now based on a statistical population distribution
> among age peers, rather than simply dividing the mental age by the
> chronological age and multiplying by 100.
>
> （5 ）Other standardized tests, such as the Scholastic Assessment Test
> (SAT) and the Graduate Record Exam (GRE), capture the main aspects of
> IQ tests.
>
> **【第四段】**
>
> （ 1 ） Such standardized tests may not assess all the important
> elements necessary to succeed in school and in life, argues Robert J.
> Sternberg.
>
> 129
>
> （2）In his article "How Intelligent Is Intelligence Testing?" ,
> Sternberg notes that traditional tests best assess analytical and
> verbal skills but fail to measure creativity and practical knowledge,
> components also critical to problem solving and life success.
>
> （3）Moreover, IQ tests do not necessarily predict so well once
> populations or situations change.
>
> （ 4 ） Research has found that IQ predicted leadership skills when
> the tests were given under low-stress conditions, but under
> high-stress conditions, IQ was negatively correlated with
> leadership---that is, it predicted the opposite.
>
> （5） ★Anyone who has toiled through SAT will testify that test-taking
> skill also matters, whether it's knowing when to guess or what
> questions to skip.
>
> **【题目】**
>
> **26.Which of the following may be required in an intelligence test?**
>
> \[A\] Answering philosophical questions.
>
> \[B\] Folding or cutting paper into different shapes.
>
> \[C\] Telling the differences between certain concepts.
>
> \[D\] Choosing words or graphs similar to the given ones.

（ 1 ） ★Studies of both animals and humans have shown that sex hormones
somehow affect the stress response, causing females under stress to
produce more of the trigger chemicals than do males under the same
conditions.

> their ovaries (the female reproductive organs) removed, their chemical
> responses became equal to those of the males.

（3 ）Men go to war and are exposed to combat stress. Men are exposed to
more acts of random physical violence.

（4）The kinds of interpersonal violence that women are exposed to tend
to be in domestic situations, by, unfortunately, parents or other family
members, and they tend not to be one-shot deals.

（1 ）The value of knowledge and the return on the public investment in
research depends, in part, upon wide distribution and ready access.

（2）It is big business. In America, the core scientific publishing
market is estimated at between \$7 billion and \$11 billion.

> （3）The International Association of Scientific, Technical and
> Medical Publishers says that there are more than 2,000 publishers
> worldwide specializing in these subjects.

> （5）There is open-access publishing, typically supported by asking

>
> （ 6 ） Finally, there are open-access archives, where organizations
> such as universities or international laboratories support
> institutional repositories.

（7 ） ★ Other models exist that are hybrids of these three, such as
delayed open-access, where journals allow only subscribers to read a
paper for the first six months, before making it freely available to
everyone who wishes to see it.

> （8）All this could change the traditional form of the peer-review
> process, at least for the publication of papers.

（1）Growth, which rarely continues beyond the age of 20, demands
calories and nutrients---notably, protein---to feed expanding tissues.

> （2）At the start of the 20th century, under-nutrition and childhood
> infections got in the way.

（3）But as diet and health improved, children and adolescents have, on
average, increased in height by about an inch and a half every 20 years,
a pattern known as the secular trend in height.

brain cells, that can jump our trains of thought onto new, innovative
tracks.

（2）He notes that each individual has many ancestors-numbering in the
hundreds just a few centuries back.

（4 ）This DNA can reveal genetic information about only one or two
ancestors, even though, for example, just three generations back people
also have six other great-grandparents or, four generations back, 14
other great-great-grandparents.

（3）This means that a DNA database may have a lot of data from some
regions and not others, so a person's test results may differ depending
on the company that processes the results.

（3）We are fortunate that it is, because building new educational
systems there and putting enough people through them to improve economic
performance would require two or three generations.

（2）★Not long ago, with the country entering a recession and Japan at
its pre-bubble peak. the U.S. workforce was derided as poorly educated
and one of the primary causes of the poor U.S. economic performance.

（1 ）More recently, while examining housing construction, the
researchers discovered that illiterate, non-English- speaking Mexican
workers in Houston, Texas, consistently met best-practice labor
productivity standards despite the complexity of the building
industry\'s work.
