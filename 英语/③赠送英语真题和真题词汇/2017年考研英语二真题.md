> **With so much focus on children\'s use of screens, it\'s easy for
> parents to forget about their own screen use. \"Tech is designed to
> really suck you in,\" says Jenny Radesky in her study of digital play,
> \"and digital products are there to promote maximal engagement. It
> makes it hard to disengage, and leads to a lot of bleed-over into the
> family routine.\"**
>
> **Radesky has studied the use of mobile phones and tablets at
> mealtimes by giving mother-child pairs a food-testing exercise. She
> found that mothers who used devices during the exercise started 20 per
> cent fewer verbal and 39 per cent fewer nonverbal interactions with
> their children. During a separate observation, she saw that phones
> became a source of tension in the family. Parents would be looking at
> their emails while the children would be making excited bids for their
> attention.**

**Infants are wired to look at parents\' faces to try to understand
their world, and if those faces are blank and unresponsive - as they
often are when absorbed in a device --- it can be extremely
disconcerting for the children. Radesky cites the \"still face
experiment\" devised by developmental psychologist Ed Tronick in the
1970s. In it, a mother is asked to interact with her child in a normal
way before putting on a blank expression and not giving them any visual
social feedback: The child becomes increasingly distressed as she tries
to capture her mother\'s attention. \"Parents don\'t have to be
exquisitely present at all times, but there needs to be a balance and
parents need to be responsive and sensitive to a child\'s verbal or
nonverbal expressions of an emotional need,\" says Radesky.**

> **On the other hand, Tronick himself is concerned that the worries
> about kids\' use of screens are born out of an \"oppressive ideology
> that demands that parents should always be interacting\" with their
> children: \"It\'s based on a somewhat fantasised, very white, very
> upper-middle-class ideology that says if you\'re failing to expose
> your child to 30,000 words you are neglecting them.\" Tronick believes
> that just because a child isn\'t learning from the screen doesn\'t
> mean there\'s no value to it--- particularly if it gives parents time
> to have a shower, do housework or simply have a break from their
> child. Parents, he says, can get a lot out of using their devices to
> speak to a friend or get some work out of the way. This can make them
> feel happier, which lets them be more available to their child the
> rest of the time.**
