In the first year or so of Web business, most of the action has revolved
a~~round effo~~rts to tap the

consumer market. More recently, as the Web proved to be more than a
fashion, companies have started

to buy ~~an~~d sell products and services with one ~~an~~other. Such
business to business sales make sense

because businesspeople typically know ~~w~~hat product they\'re looking
for.

Nonetheless, m~~an~~y co~~mpan~~ies still hesitate to use the Web
because of doubts ~~a~~bout its reli~~a~~bility.

> \"Businesses need to feel they can trust the pathway between them
> ![](media/image9.jpeg){width="1.665573053368329e-3in"
> height="1.5e-2in"}and the s~~u~~pplier,\" says senior

analyst Blane Erwin of Forrester Research. Some companies are
li~~m~~iting the risk by conducting online

![](media/image10.jpeg){width="7.999890638670167e-2in"
height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}transactions only with established
business partners who are given access to the company\'s private

> i~~ntra~~net.

Another major shift in the model for Internet commerce concerns the
technology available for

marketing. Until rece~~n~~tly, Internet marketing activities have
focused on strategies to \"pull\" customers

into sites. In the past year, however, software companies ha~~v~~e
developed tools that allow companies to

\"push\" information directly out to consumers, t~~ran~~smitting
m~~ar~~keting messages directly to targeted

customers. Most notably, the Pointcast Network uses a screen sa~~v~~er
to deliver a continually ~~u~~pdated

stream of news and advertisements to subscribers\' co~~mp~~uter
monitors. Subscribers c~~an~~ custo~~m~~ize the

![](media/image10.jpeg){width="7.999890638670167e-2in"
height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}information they want to receive and
proceed directly to a company\'s Web site. Companies such as

> contempt of many![](media/image11.jpeg){width="0.0in"
> height="4.998906386701662e-3in"}

Web users. Online culture thinks hi~~g~~hly of the notion th~~a~~t the
information flowing onto the screen

comes there by specific request. Once commercial promotion begins to
fill the screen unin~~v~~ited, the

B~~u~~t it is hardly inevitable that companies on the Web will need to
resort to push strategies to

![](media/image13.jpeg){width="7.999890638670167e-2in"
height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}make money. The examples of Virtual

height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}site selling the ri~~g~~ht kind of
products with the ri~~g~~ht mix of interactivity, hospitality, ~~an~~d

attract online customers. And the cost of comp~~u~~ting power continues
to free fall, ~~w~~hich is a good sign

When a Scottish research team startled the world by revealing 3 months
ago th~~a~~t it had cloned ~~an~~

height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}adult sheep, President Clinton moved
swiftly. Declaring that he was opposed to using this ~~unu~~sual

![](media/image39.jpeg){width="3.666557305336833e-2in"
height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}~~an~~imal husbandry technique to clone
humans, he ordered th~~a~~t federal funds not be used for such ~~an~~

e~~x~~periment-although no one had proposed to do so-and asked an
independent panel of e~~x~~perts

chaired by Princeton Preside~~n~~t H~~aro~~ld Shapiro to report back to
the White House in 90 d~~a~~ys with

recommendations for a national policy on human cloning. That gro~~u~~p -
the National Bioethics

Advisory Co~~mm~~ission (NBAC)-has been wo~~r~~king feverishly to put
its wisdom on paper, ~~an~~d at a

> meeting on 17 May, members agreed on a near final draft of their
> recommendations.

NBAC will ask that Clinton \' s 90 d~~a~~y b~~an~~ on federal funds for
human cloning be extended

indefinitely, and possibly that it be made la~~w~~. But NBAC members are
planning to word the

recommendation narrowly to avoid new restrictions on rese~~ar~~ch that
involves the cloning of hum~~an~~

DNA or cells~~-rou~~tine in molecular biology. The panel has not yet
reached agreement on a crucial

question,however, whether to recommend legislation that would
m![](media/image40.jpeg){width="0.0in" height="1.665573053368329e-3in"}
akeit a crime for private funding to

be used for h~~u~~man cloning.

![](media/image41.jpeg){width="0.10500109361329833in"
height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}In a d~~ra~~ft preface to the
reco~~mm~~end~~a~~tions, discussed at the 17 May meeting, Shapiro
suggested

that the panel had found a broad consensus that it would be \"morally
~~u~~nacceptable to attempt to create

> a human child by adult ~~n~~uclear cloning.\" Shapiro explained
> du~~r~~ing the meeting th~~a~~t the moral doubt stems mainly from
> fears about the risk to the health of the child. The panel then
> informally accepted
>
> several general conclusions, althou~~g~~h some details have not been
> settled.

NBAC plans to call for a contin~~u~~ed ban on federal government funding
for ![](media/image42.jpeg){width="1.665573053368329e-3in"
height="1.5e-2in"}any
![](media/image43.jpeg){width="1.665573053368329e-3in"
height="1.5e-2in"}attempt to clone

body cell nuclei to cre~~a~~te a child. Bec~~a~~use cu~~rr~~ent federal
law already fo~~r~~bids the use of federal funds

to create embryos (the earliest stage of human offspring before birth)
for research or to knowingly

![](media/image44.jpeg){width="0.10333442694663167in"
height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}NBAC me~~m~~bers also indicated th~~a~~t
they would appeal to privately funded rese~~ar~~chers ~~an~~d clinics

not to try to clone humans by body cell nuclear transfer. But they were
divided on ~~w~~hether to go

height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}further by calling for a federal law
that would i四ose a co四leteban on human cloning. Shapiro ~~an~~d

most members favored an appeal for such legislation, b~~u~~t in a phone
interview, he said this issue was

How many men would have considered the possibility of an apple falling
u~~p in~~to the tree?

Newton did because he was not trying to predict ~~an~~ything. He was
just wondering. His mind was ready

for the unpredictable. Unpredictability is part of the essential nature
of research. If you don\'t have

What this amounts to, of course, is that the scientist has become the
victim of his o~~wn w~~ritings.

31\) [While there are almost as many definitions of history as there are
historians, modem practice]{.underline} [most closely conforms to one
that sees history as the attempt to recreate and explain the
significant]{.underline} [events of the past.]{.underline} Caught in the
web of its own time and place, each generation of historians determines
anew what is significant for it in the past. In this search the evidence
found is always incomplete and scattered; it is also frequently partial
or partisan. The irony of the historian\'s craft is that its
practitioners always know that their efforts are but contributions to an
unending process.

32 ) [Interest in historical methods has arisen less through external
challenge to the validity of]{.underline} [history as an intellectual
discipline and more from internal quarrels among historians
themselves.]{.underline} While history once revered its affinity to
literature and philosophy, the emerging social sciences seemed to afford
greater opportunities for asking new questions and providing rewarding
approaches to an understanding of the past. Social science methodologies
had to be adapted to a discipline governed by the primacy of historical
sources rather than the imperatives of the contemporary world. 33)
[During this transfer, traditional historical methods were augmented by
additional methodologies]{.underline} [designed to interpret the new
forms of evidence in the historical study.]{.underline}

Methodology is a term that remains inherently ambiguous in the
historical profession. 34) [There]{.underline} [is no agreement whether
methodology refers to the concepts peculiar to historical work in
general or to]{.underline} [the research techniques appropriate to the
various branches of historical inquiry.]{.underline} Historians,
especially those so blinded by their research interests that they have
been accused of \"tunnel method,\" frequently fall victim to the
\"technical fallacy.\" Also common in the natural sciences, the
technicist fallacy mistakenly identifies the discipline as a whole with
certain parts of its technical implementation.
