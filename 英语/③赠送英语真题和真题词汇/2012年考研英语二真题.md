unavoidable, somehow encoded in their DNA, but according to Jo Paoletti,
an associ~~a~~te professor of American Studies, it is not. Children were
not colour-coded at all until the early 20th century: in the era before
domestic washing machines all babies wore white as a practical matter,
since the only way of getting clothes clean was to boil them. What\'s
more, both boys and girls wore what were thought of as gender-neutral
dresses. When nursery colours were introduced, pink was actually
considered the more masculine colour, a pastel version of red, which was
associated with strength. Blue, with its intimations of the Virgin Mary,
constancy and faithfulness, symbolised femininity. It was not until the
mid-1980s, when amplifying age** ·**and sex differences
became**![](media/image41.jpeg){width="0.0in"

height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}**In 2010, a federal judge shook
America\'s biotech industry to its core. Companies had won patents for
isolated DNA for decades --- by 2005 some 20% of human genes were
patented. But in March 2010 a judge ruled that genes were unpatentable.
Executives were violently agitated. The Biotechnology Industry
Organisation (BIO), a trade group, assured members that this was just a
\"preliminary step\" in a longer battle.**
