21\. According to Paragraph 1, Ms. Simmons was criticized
for![](media/image23.jpeg){width="0.4544313210848644in"

22\. We learn from Paragraph 2 that outside directors ~~ar~~e
su~~p~~posed to be![](media/image24.jpeg){width="0.4519313210848644in"

24\. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that outside
directors![](media/image26.jpeg){width="0.4571095800524934in"
