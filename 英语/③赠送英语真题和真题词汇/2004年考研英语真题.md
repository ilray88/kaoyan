Many theories concerning the causes of juvenile delinquency (crimes

as the major contributing influence. Theories [l]{.underline} on the

Some sites design their agents to tempt job hunters to return. When
CareerSite\'s agent sends out messages to those who have signed up for
its service, for example, it includes only three potential jobs-those it
considers the best matches. There maybe more matches in the database;
job hunters will have to visit the site again to find them-and they do.
\"On the day after we send our messages, we see a sharp increase in our
traffic,\" says Seth Peets, vicepresident of marketing for CareerSite.
