The longest bull run in a century of art-market history ended on a

The world art market had already been losing momentum for a ~~w~~hile
after rising bewilderingly since 2003 . At itspeak in 2007 it was worth
some \$65 billion, reckons Clare McAndrew, founder of Arts Economics, a
research firm - double the figure five

I was addressing a small gathering in a suburban Virginia living room -
a

women\'s group that had invited men to join them. Throughout the
evening, one man

had been particularly talkative, fre~~q~~uently offering ideas and
anecdotes, while his

wife sat silently beside him on the couch. Toward the end of the
evening, I

> commented that women frequently complain that their husbands don\'t
> talk to them.
>
> This man quickly nodded in agreement. He gestured toward his wife and
> said, \"She\'s

the talker in our family.\" The room burst into laughter; the man looked
puzzled and

> hurt. \"It\'s true,\" he explained. \"When I come home from work I
> have nothing to say.
>
> If she didn\'t keep the conversation going, we\'d ~~s~~pend the whole
> evening in silence.\"

This episode crystallizes the iron~~y~~ that although American men tend
to talk more

> than women in public situations, they often talk less at home. And
> this pattern is [wreaking havoc]{.underline} with marriage.

The pattern was observed by political scientist Andrew Hacker in the
late 1970s.

height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}Sociologist Catherine Kohler
Riessm~~an~~ reports in her new book Divorce Talk that most of the women
she interviewed - but only a few of the men - gave lack of

co~~mm~~unication as the reason for their divorces. Given the current
divorce rate of

nearly 50 percent, that amounts to millions of cases in the United
States every year ![](media/image14.jpeg){width="8.333333333333333e-2in"

they focused on communication: \"He doesn\'t listen to me.\" \"He

A few decades ago, many people didn\'t drink water o~~u~~tside of a
meal. Then beverage companies started bottling the production of
far-offsprings, and now office

![](media/image3.jpeg){width="1.0e-2in"
height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}workers unthinkingly sip bottled water
all day long. Chewing gum, once bought primarily by adolescent boys, is
now featured in commercials as a breath freshener and teeth cleanser for
use after a meal. Skin moisturizers are advertised as part of morning
beauty rituals, slipped in between hair brushing and putting on makeup.

It remains to be seen how weather conditions affect the air flows that
make

formation flight more efficient. In zones of increased turbulence, the
planes\' wakes

will decay more quickly and the effect will diminish. Dr. Kroo says this

It didn\'t go well. \"It was a really bad move because that\'s not my
passion,\" s~~a~~ys Ning, whose dilemma about the job translated,
predictably, into a lack of sales. \"I was miserable. I had so much
anxiety that I would wake up in the middle of the night and stare at the
ceiling. I had no money and needed the job. Everyone said, \'Just wait,
