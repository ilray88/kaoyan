Specialisation can be seen as a response to the problem of an increasing
accumulation of scientific knowledge. By splitting up the subject matter
into smaller units ，one man could continue to handle the information
and use it as the basis for further research. But specialisation was
only one of a series of related developments in science affecting the
process of communication. Another was the growing professionalisation of
scientific activity.

A comparison of British geological publications over the last century
and a half reveals not simply an increasing emphasis on the primacy of
research, but also a changing definition of what constitutes an
acceptable research paper. Thus, in the nineteenth century, local
geological studies represented worthwhile research in their own right;
but, in the twentieth century, local studies have increasingly become
acceptable to professionals only if they incorporate, and reflect on,
the wider geological picture. Amateurs, on the other hand, have
continued to pursue local studies in the old way. The overall result has
been to make entrance to professional geological journals harder for
amateurs, a result that has been reinforced by the widespread
introduction of refereeing, first by national journals in the nineteenth
century and then by several local geological journals in the twentieth
century. As a logical consequence of this development, separate journals
have now appeared aimed mainly towards either professional or amateur
readership. A rather similar process of differentiation has led to
professional geologists coming together nationally within one or two
specific societies, whereas the amateurs have tended either to remain in
local societies or to come together nationally in a different way.

There are technological reasons to hope the digital divide will narrow.
As the Internet becomes more and more commercialized, it is in the
interest of business to universalize access-after all, the more people
online, the more potential customers there are. More and more
governments, afraid their countries will be left behind, want to spread
Internet access. Within the next decade or two, one to two billion
people on the planet will he netted together. As a result, I now believe
the digital divide will narrow rather than widen in the years ahead. And
that is very good news because the Internet may well be the most
powerful tool for combating world poverty that we've ever had.

To take advantage of this tool, some impoverished countries will have to
get over their outdated anti-colonial prejudices with respect to foreign
investment. Countries that still think foreign investment is an invasion
of their sovereignty might well study the history of infrastructure（the
basic structural foundations of a society）in the United States. When
the United States built its industrial infrastructure, it didn't have
the capital to do so. And that is why America's Second Wave
infrastructure-including roads, harbors, highways, ports and so on-were
built with foreign investment. The English, the Germans, the Dutch and
the French were investing in Britain's former colony. They financed
them. Immigrant Americans built them. Guess who owns them now? The
Americans. I believe the same thing would be true in places like Brazil
or anywhere else for that matter. The more foreign capital you have
helping you build your Third Wave infrastructure, which today is an
electronic infrastructure, the better off you're going to be. That
doesn\'t mean lying down and becoming fooled, or letting foreign
corporations run uncontrolled. But it does mean recognizing how
important they can be in building the energy and telecom infrastructures
needed to take full advantage of the Internet.

Why do so many Americans distrust what they read in their newspapers?
The American Society of Newspaper Editors is trying to answer this
painful question. The organization is deep into a long self-analysis
known as the journalism credibility project.

Examples of benefits or costs of the current concentration wave are
scanty. Yet it is hard to imagine that the merger of a few oil firms
today could re-create the same threats to competition that were feared
nearly a century ago in the U.S., when the Standard Oil trust was broken
up. The mergers of telecom companies, such as WorldCom, hardly seem to
bring higher prices for consumers or a reduction in the pace of
technical progress. On the contrary, the price of communications is
coming down fast. In cars, too, concentration is increasing-witness
Daimler and Chrysler, Renault and Nissan-but it does not appear that
consumers are being hurt.

When I decided to quit my full time employment it never occurred to me
that I might become a part of a new international trend. A lateral move
that hurt my pride and blocked my professional progress prompted me to
abandon my relatively high profile career although, in the manner of a
disgraced government minister, I covered my exit by claiming "I wanted
to spend more time with my family" .

> by Linda Kelsey for the past seven years in the pages of She magazine,
> into a woman who is happy to settle for a bit of everything.

I have discovered, as perhaps Kelsey will after her much-publicized
resignation from the editorship of She after a build-up of stress, that
abandoning the doctrine of "juggling your life", and making the
alternative move into "downshifting" brings with it far greater rewards
than financial success and social status. Nothing could persuade me to
return to the kind of life Kelsey used to advocate and I once enjoyed:
12-hour working days, pressured deadlines, the fearful strain of office
politics and the limitations of being a parent on "quality time" .

In less than 30 years ' time the Star Trek holodeck will be a reality.
Direct links between the brain's nervous system and a computer will also
create full sensory virtual environments, allowing virtual vacations
like those in the film Total Recall.

Through his research, Pearson is able to put dates to most of the
breakthroughs that can be predicted. However, there are still no
forecasts for when faster-than-light travel will be available, or when
human cloning will be perfected, or when time travel will be possible.
But he does expect social problems as a result of technological
advances. A boom in neighborhood surveillance cameras will, for example,
cause problems in 2010, while the arrival of synthetic lifelike robots
will mean people may not be able to distinguish between their human
friends and the droids.
