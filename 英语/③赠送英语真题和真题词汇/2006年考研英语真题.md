21.The word \"homogenizing\" (Line 2, Paragraph 1) most probably means
\[A\] identifying.

The townsfolk don\'t see it this way and the local council does not
contribute directly to the subsidy of the Royal Shakespeare Company.
[Stratford cries poor traditionally]{.underline}. Nevertheless every
hotel in town seems to be adding a new wing or cocktail lounge. Hilton
is building its own hotel there, which you may be sure will be decorated
with Hamlet Hamburger Bars, the Lear Lounge, the Banquo Banqueting Room,
and so forth, and will be very expensive.

26\. From the first two paragraphs, we learn that

height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}27. It can be inferred from Paragraph 3
that

> ![](media/image16.jpeg){width="0.145in"

![](media/image17.jpeg){width="0.10166666666666667in"
height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}28. By saying \"Stratford cries poor
traditionally\" (Line 2, Paragraph 4),the author implies that

> ![](media/image18.jpeg){width="7.000109361329834e-2in"
> height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}\[A\] Stratford cannot afford the

>
> \[D\] the townsfolk used to be poorly paid.

29\. According to the townsfolk, the RSC deserves no subsidy bec~~a~~use
\[A\] ticket prices can be raised to cover the spending.

That the seas ~~ar~~e being overfished has been known for years. What
researchers such as Ransom Myers ~~an~~d Boris Worm have shown is just
how fast things are changing. They h~~a~~ve looked at half a century of
data from fisheries around the world. Their methods do not attempt to
estimate the actual biomass (the amount of living biological matter) of
fish species in particular parts of the ocean, but rather changes in
that biomass over time. According to their latest paper published in
Nature, the biomass of large predators (~~an~~imals that kill and eat
other animals) in a new fishery is reduced on average by 80% within 15
years of the start of exploitation. In some long- fished areas, it has
halved again since then.

Today the messages the average Westerner is surrounded with are not
religious but commercial, and forever happy. Fast-food eaters, news
anchors, text messengers, all smiling, smiling, smiling. Our magazines
feature beaming celebrities and happy families in perfect homes. And
since these messages have an agenda - to lure us to open our wallets -
they make the very idea of happiness seem unreliable.\"Celebrate!\"

First, the object of o~~u~~r study pleads for definition. What is an
intellectual? (46) \_I ·[shall define him as an individual who has
elected as his primary duty and]{.underline} [pleasure in life the
activity of thinking in a Socratic( in, 格 拉\[ij;) way about
moral]{.underline} [problems.]{.underline} He e~~x~~plores such problems
consciously, articulately, and frankly, first by asking factual
questions, then by asking moral questions, finally by suggesting action

This definition excludes many individuals usually referred to as
intellectuals - the average scientist, for one. (48) [I have excluded
him because, ~~w~~hile]{.underline} [his accomplishments may contribute
to the solution of moral problems, he has not]{.underline} [been
ch~~ar~~ged with the task of approaching any but the factual aspects of
those]{.underline} [problems]{.underline}. Like other human beings, he
encounters moral issues even in the everyday

> his primary task is not to think]{.underline} [about the moral code

The definition also excludes the majority of teachers, despite the fact
