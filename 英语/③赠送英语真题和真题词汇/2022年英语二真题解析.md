46.有时虽然我们尽了最大的努力，但我们的绘画作品很少能像原计划的那样呈现。光线的
变化，绘画材料的局限性以及经验和技术的缺乏意味着你刚开始尝试实现的目标可能不会以你
期望的方式实现。尽管这可能令人沮丧和失望，但事实证明这实际上会对你有好处。这些
意想不到的结果有两个好处：

你很快就学会了处理失望，并意识到当一扇门关闭时，另一扇门就会打开。你也很快学会
适应并提出创造性的解决方案来解决绘画所展现出的问题，并且跳出思维定势进行思考将成为
你的第二天性。事实上，创造性解决问题的技能在日常生活中非常有用。当问题出现时，通过这些
技能，你更有可能找到解决方案。

> The bar chart gives information about the express delivery volume in
> China from 2018 to

2020.As is accurately demonstrated in the chart,there exists obvious
increase in terms of express delivery volume in China.To be exact,the
general volume has increased from 51 billion to 83 billion during the
past three years.Accordingly,the volume in rural areas has increased
from 12 billion to 30 billion.

It is of no difficulty for us to come up with some possible factors for
this trend.Tobegin with, with the rapid development of the Internet and
the e-commerce,an increasing number of people

like to shop online,so express industry has made astounding
advances.What\'s more,compared

with shopping in physical shops,there are more advantages of shopping
online,such as the lower price and more choices,attracting more and more
people in rural areas where the transportation is not so convenient to
purchase their daily necessities and new high-tech products online,which
leads to the rapid increase in the express delivery volume in the rural
areas.

From the above discussion,we may come to the conclusion that the express
delivery would become increasingly popular among people and this trend
will certainly maintain for quite a while in the years ahead.
