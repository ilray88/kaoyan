**The readiness of the rats to befriend the social robot was surprising

secure employment (followed by professional development and training,

We can choose to see failure as "the end of the world" . Or, we can look
at failure as the incredible learning experience that it often is. Every
time we fail at something, we can choose to look for the lesson we're
meant to learn. These lessons are very important; they're how we grow,
and how we keep from making that same mistake again. Failures stop us
only if we let them.

Failure can also teach us things about ourselves that we would never
have learned otherwise. For instance, failure can help you discover how
strong a person you are. Failing at something can help you discover your
truest friends, or help you find unexpected motivation to succeed.
