Read the following text. Choose the best word(s) for each numbered blank
and mark A, B, C or D on ANSWER SHEET 1. (10 points)

By 1830 the former Spanish and Portuguese colonies had become
independent nations. The roughly 20 million [1]{.underline} of these
nations looked [2]{.underline} to the future. Born in the crisis of the
old regime and Iberian colonialism, many of the leaders of independence
[3]{.underline} the ideals of representative government, careers
[4]{.underline} to talent, freedom of commerce and trade, the
[5]{.underline} to private property, and a belief in the individual as
the basis of society. [6]{.underline} there was a belief that the new
nations should be sovereign and independent states, large enough to be
economically viable and integrated by a [7]{.underline} set of laws.

On the issue of [8]{.underline} of religion and the position of the
Church, [9]{.underline} , there was less agreement [10]{.underline} the
leadership. Roman Catholicism had been the state religion and the only
on[e 11]{.underline} by the Spanish crown. [12]{.underline} most leaders
sought to maintain Catholicism [13]{.underline} the official religion of
the new states, some sought to end the [14]{.underline} of other faiths.
The defense of the Church became a rallying [15]{.underline} for the
conservative forces.

The ideals of the early leaders of independence were often egalitarian,
valuing equality of everything. Bolivar had received aid from Haiti and
had [16]{.underline} in return to abolish slavery in the areas he
liberated. By 1854 slavery had been abolished everywhere except Spain' s
[17]{.underline} colonies. Early promises to end Indian tribute and
taxes on people of mixed origin came much [18]{.underline} because the
new nations still needed the revenue such policies [19]{.underline} .
Egalitarian sentiments were often tempered by fears that the mass of the
population was [20]{.underline} self-rule and democracy.

If you were to examine the birth certificates of every soccer player in
2006's World Cup tournament, you would most likely find a noteworthy
quirk: elite soccer players are more likely to have been born in the
earlier months of the year than in the later months. If you then
examined the European national youth teams that feed the World Cup and
professional ranks, you would find this strange phenomenon to be even
more pronounced.

Ericsson and his colleagues have thus taken to studying expert
performers in a wide range of pursuits, including soccer. They gather
all the data they can, not just performance statistics and biographical
details but also the results of their own laboratory experiments with
high achievers. Their work makes a rather startling assertion: the trait
we commonly call talent is highly overrated. Or, put another way, expert
performers -- whether in memory or surgery, ballet or computer
programming-- are nearly always made, not born.

For the past several years, the Sunday newspaper supplement *Parade* has
featured a column called "Ask Marilyn." People are invited to query
Marilyn vos Savant, who at age 10 had tested at a mental level of
someone about 23 years old; that gave her an IQ of 228 -- the highest
score ever recorded. IQ tests ask you to complete verbal and visual
analogies, to envision paper after it has been folded and cut, and to
deduce numerical sequences, among other similar tasks. So it is a bit
confusing when vos Savant fields such queries from the average Joe
(whose IQ is 100) as, What's the difference between love and fondness?
Or what is the nature of luck and coincidence? It' s not obvious how the
capacity to visualize objects and to figure out numerical patterns suits
one to answer questions that have eluded some of the best poets and
philosophers.

> genetics, computer science and other fields?

The defining term of intelligence in humans still seems to be the IQ
score, even though IQ tests are not given as often as they used to be.
The test comes primarily in two forms: the Stanford-Binet Intelligence
Scale and the Wechsler Intelligence Scales (both come in adult and
children' s version). Generally costing several hundred dollars, they
are usually given only by psychologists, although variations of them
populate bookstores and the World Wide Web. Superhigh scores like vos
Savant' s are no longer possible, because scoring is now based on a
statistical population distribution among age peers, rather than simply
dividing the mental age by the chronological age and multiplying by 100.
Other standardized tests, such as the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT)
and the Graduate Record Exam (GRE), capture the main aspects of IQ
tests.

In just one generation, millions of mothers have gone to work,
transforming basic family economics. Scholars, policymakers, and critics
of all stripes have debated the social implications of these changes,
but few have looked at the side effect: family risk has risen as well.
Today' s families have budgeted to the limits of their new two-paycheck
status. As a result, they have lost the parachute they once had in times
of financial setback -- a back-up earner (usually Mom) who could go into
the workforce if the primary earner got laid off or fell sick. This
"added-worker effect" could support the safety net offered by
unemployment insurance or disability insurance to help families weather
bad times. But today, a disruption to family fortunes can no longer be
made up with extra income from an otherwise-stay-at-home partner.

During the same period, families have been asked to absorb much more
risk in their retirement income. Steelworkers, airline employees, and
now those in the auto industry are joining millions of families who must
worry about interest rates, stock market fluctuation, and the harsh
reality that they may outlive their retirement money. For much of the
past year, President Bush campaigned to move Social Security to a
savings-account model, with retirees trading much or all of their
guaranteed payments for payments depending on investment returns. For
younger families, the picture is not any better. Both the absolute cost
of healthcare and the share of it borne by families have risen -- and
newly fashionable health-savings plans are spreading from legislative
halls to Wal-Mart workers, with much higher deductibles and a large new
dose of investment risk for families' future healthcare. Even
demographics are working against the middle class family, as the odds of
having a weak elderly parent-- and all the attendant need for physical
and financial assistance -- have jumped eightfold in just one
generation.

"Data is becoming an asset which needs to be guarded as much as any
other asset," says Haim Mendelson of Stanford University' s business
school. "The ability to guard customer data is the key to market value,
which the board is responsible for on behalf of shareholders" . Indeed,
just as there is the concept of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(GAAP), perhaps it is time for GASP, Generally Accepted Security
Practices, suggested Eli Noam of New York' s Columbia Business School.
"Setting the proper investment level for security, redundancy, and
recovery is a management issue, not a technical one," he says.

Teachers are responsible for teaching kids how to learn; parents should
be responsible for teaching them how to work. Assign responsibilities
around the house and make sure homework deadlines are met. Encourage
teenagers to take a part-time job. Kids need plenty of practice delaying
gratification and deploying effective organizational skills, such as
managing time and setting priorities.

Furthermore, the legal system and the events which occur within it are
primary subjects for journalists. While the quality of legal journalism
varies greatly, there is an undue reliance amongst many journalists on
interpretations supplied to them by lawyers. (50) [While comment and
reaction from lawyers may enhance stories, it i]{.underline}s
[preferable for journalists to rely on their own notions of significance
and make thei]{.underline}r [own judgments.]{.underline} These can only
come from a well-grounded understanding of the legal system.
