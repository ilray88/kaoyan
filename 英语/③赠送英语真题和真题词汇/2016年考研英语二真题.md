height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}**Under the plan, for example, the
agency said it would not prosecute landowners or businesses that
unintentionally kill, harm, or disturb the bird, as long as they had
signed a range-wide management plan to restore prairie chicken habitat.
Negotiated by USFWS and the states, the plan requires individuals and
businesses that damage habitat as part of their operations to pay into a
fund to replace every acre destroyed with 2 new acres of suitable
habitat. The fund will also be used to compensate landowners who set
aside habitat. USFWS also set an interim goal of restoring prairie
chicken populations to an annual average of 67,000 birds over the next
10 years. And it gives the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife
Agencies (WAFWA), a coalition of state agencies, the job of monitoring
progress. Overall, the idea is to let \"states remain in the driver\'s
seat for managing the species,\" Ashe said.**

sixties. But while young** .**and old mostly agree on what constitutes
the finish line of a fulfilling life, they offer strikingly different
paths for reaching it.**

**Young people who are still getting started in life were more likely
than older adults to prioritize personal fulfillment in their work, to
believe they will advance their careers most by regularly changing jobs,
to favor communities with more public services and a faster pace of
life, to agree that couples should be financially secure before getting
married or having children, and to maintain that children are best
served by two parents working outside the home, the survey found.**

**From career to community and family, these contrasts suggest that in
the aftermath of the searing Great Recession, those just starting out in
life are defining priorities and expectations that will increasingly
spread through virtually all aspects of American life, from consumer
preferences to housing patterns to politics. Young and old converge on
one key point: Overwhelming majorities of both groups said they believe
it is harder for young people today to get started in life than it was
for earlier generations. While younger people are somewhat more
optimistic than their elders about the prospects for those starting out
today, big majorities in both groups believe those \"just getting
started in life\" face a tougher climb than earlier generations in
reaching such signpost achievements as securing a good-paying job,
starting a family, managing debt, and finding affordable housing.**

**As adults, it seems that we are constantly pursuing happiness, often
with mixed results. Yet children appear to have it down to an art ---
and for the most part they don\'t need self-help books or therapy.
Instead, they look after their wellbeing instinctively, and usually more
effectively than we do as grownups. Perhaps it\'s time to learn a few
lessons from them.**
