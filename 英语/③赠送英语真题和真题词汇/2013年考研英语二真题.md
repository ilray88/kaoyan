you might think that we would move quickly to the cashless society in
which all payments are made electronically. 1 , a true cashless society
is probably not around the comer. Indeed, predictions have been 2 for
two decades but have not yet come to fruition. For example, Business
Week predicted in 1975 that electronic means of payment would soon
\"revolutionize the very 3 of money itself,\" only to 4 itself several
years later. Why has the movement to a cashless society been so 5
incoming?**

**Although electronic means of payment may be more efficient than a
payments system based on paper, several factors work 6 the disappearance
of the paper system. First, it is very 7 to set up the computer, card
reader, and telecommunications networks necessary to make electronic
money the义 form of payment. Second, paper checks have the advantage
that they 9 receipts, something that many consumers are unwilling to 10
. Third, the use of paper checks gives consumers several days of
\"float\" --- it takes several days 11 a check is cashed and funds are
12 from the issuer\'s account, which means that the writer of the check
can earn interest on the funds in the meantime. 13 electronic payments
arc in**Ⅶ**ediate, they eliminate the float for the consumer.**

**Fourth, electronic means of payment may 14 security and privacy
concerns. We often hear media reports that an unauthorized hacker has
been able to access a computer database and to alter information 15
there. The fact that this is not an_l_Q occurrence means that dishonest
persons might be able to access bank accounts in electronic payments
systems and 17 from someone else\'s accounts. The 18 of this type of
fraud is no easy task, and a new field of computer science is developing
to」..2. security issues. A further concern is that the use of
electronic means of payment leaves an electronic 20 that contains a
large amount of personal data. There are concerns that government,
employers, and marketers might be able to access these data, thereby
violating our privacy.**
