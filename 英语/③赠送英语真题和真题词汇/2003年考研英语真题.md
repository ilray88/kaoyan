Wild Bill Donovan would have loved the Internet. The American spymaster
who built the Office of Strategic Services in the World War II and later
laid the roots for the CIA was fascinated with information. Donovan
believed in using whatever tools came to hand in the \"great game\" of
espionage -spying as a \"profession.\" These days the Net, which has
already re-made such everyday pastimes as buying books and sending mail,
is reshaping Donovan\'s vocation as well.

Friedman relies on a lean staff of 20 m Austin. Several of his staff
members have military-intelligence backgrounds. He sees the firm\'s
outsider status as the key to its success. Straitford\'s briefs don\'t
sound like the usual Washington back-and-forthing, whereby agencies
avoid dramatic declarations on the chance they might be wrong.
Straitford, says Friedman, takes pride in its independent voice.

Scientists must communicate their message to the public in a
compassionate, understandable way-in human terms, not in the language of
molecular biology. We need to make clear the connection between animal
research and a grandmother\'s hip replacement, a father\'s bypass
operation, a baby\'s vaccinations, and even a pet\'s shots. To those who
are unaware that animal research was needed to produce these treatments,
as well as new treatments and vaccines, animal research seems wasteful
at best and cruel at worst.

In recent years, railroads ha~~v~~e been combining with each other,
merging into s~~u~~persystems,

> ![](media/image2.jpeg){width="7.999890638670167e-2in"

Supporters of the new s~~u~~persystems argue that these mergers will
allow for s~~u~~bstantial cost

![](media/image2.jpeg){width="7.999890638670167e-2in"
height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}reductions and better coordinated
service. Any threat of monopoly, they argue, is removed by fierce

competition from trucks. But many shippers complain that for hea~~vy~~
bulk commodities traveling long

distances, such as coal, chemicals, and grain, trucking is too costly
and the railroads therefore ha~~v~~e

> them by the throat.

The vast consolidation within the rail industry means that most shippers
are served by only one

rail company. Railroads typically charge such \" captive \" shippers 20
to 30 percent more than they do

when another railroad is competing for the business. Shippers ~~w~~ho
feel they are being overcharged

height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}Railroads justify rate discrimination
against captive shippers on the grou~~n~~ds that in the long ~~r~~un it

reduces everyone\'s cost. If railroads charged all customers the same

Many captive shippers also worry they will soon be hit with a ro~~u~~nd
of h~~u~~ge rate increases. The

railroad industry as a whole, despite its bri~~g~~htening fortuning
fortu~~n~~es, still does not earn enough to

![](media/image9.jpeg){width="3.500109361329834e-2in"
height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}cover the cost of the capital it
~~m~~ust invest to keep up with its su~~r~~ging traffic. Yet railroads
continue to

![](media/image10.jpeg){width="0.148332239720035in"
height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}borrow billions to acquire one another,
with Wall Street cheering them on. Consider the \$10.2 billion

bid by Norfolk Southern and CSX to acquire Conrail this ye~~ar~~.
Conrail\'s net railway ope~~ra~~ting income

in 1996 was just \$427 million, less th~~an~~ half of the c~~a~~rrying
costs of the transaction. Who\'s going to

height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}pay for the rest of the bill? M~~an~~y
captive shippers fear that they will, as Norfolk Southern ~~an~~d CSX
increase their grip on the market.

It is said th~~a~~t in England de~~a~~th is pressing, in C~~an~~ada
inevit~~a~~ble and in California optional. Small

wonder. Americans\' life e~~x~~pectancy has nearly do~~u~~bled over the
past century. Failing hips can be

replaced, clinical depression controlled, cataracts removed in a
30-minute surgical procedure. Such

advances offer the aging population a quality of life that was

Death is normal; we ~~ar~~e genetically programmed to disintegrate and
perish, even under ideal

conditions. We all ~~u~~nderstand that at some level, yet as medical
consumers we treat death as a problem

height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}to be solved. Shielded by
third-p~~a~~rty payers from the cost of our c~~ar~~e, we demand
everything that can

possibly be done for us, even if it\'s useless. The most obvious example
is late-stage cancer care.

In 1950, the US spent \$12.7 billion on health care. In 2002, the cost
will be \$1,540 billion.

I would not go that far. Ene~~r~~getic people now routinely wo~~r~~k

remain dazzlingly productive. At 78, Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone
