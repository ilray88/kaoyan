"Reskilling"is something that sounds like a buzzword but is actually a
requirement if we plan to have a future where a lot of would-be workers
do not get left behind.We know we are moving into a period where the
jobs in demand will change rapidly,as will the requirements of the jobs
that remain.Research by the World Economic Forum finds that on average
42 per cent of the"core skills"within job roles will change by 2022.That
is a very short timeline.

The question of who should pay for reskilling is a thorny one.For
individual companies,the temptation is always to let go of workers whose
skills are no longer in demand and replace them with those whose skills
are.That does not always happen AT&T is often given as the gold standard
of a company who decided to do a massive reskilling program rather than
go with a fire-and-hire strategy.Other companies including Amazon and
Disney had also pledged to create their own plans.When the skills
mismatch is in the broader economy though,the focus usually turns to
government to handle.Efforts in Canada and elsewhere have been arguably
languid at best,and have given us a situation where we frequently hear
of employers begging for workers,even at times and in regions where
unemployment is high.

With the pandemic,unemployment is very high indeed.In February,at 3.5
per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively,unemployment rates in Canada and
the United States were at generational lows and worker shortages were
everywhere.As of May,those rates had spiked up to 13.3 per cent and 13.7
per cent,and although many worker shortages had disappeared,not all had
done so.In the medical field,to take an obvious example,the pandemic
meant that there were still clear shortages of doctors,nurses and other
medical personnel.

Of course,it is not like you can take an unemployed waiter and train him
to be a doctor in a few weeks,no matter who pays for it.But even if you
cannot close that gap, maybe you can close others,and doing so would be
to the benefit of all concerned.That seems to be the case in Sweden:When
forced to furlough 90 per cent of their cabin staff,Scandinavian
Airlines decided to start up a short retraining program that reskilled
the laid-off workers to support hospital staff.The effort was a
collective one and involved other companies as well as a Swedish
university.

With the global population predicted to hit close to 10 billion by
2050,and forecasts that agricultural production in some regions will
need to nearly double to keep pace,food security is increasingly making
headlines.In the UK,it has become a big talking point recently too,for a
rather particular reason:Brexit.

Brexit is seen by some as an opportunity to reverse a recent trend
towards the UK importing food.The country produces only about 60 per
cent of the food it eats,down from almost three-quarters in the late
1980s.A move back to self-sufficiency,the argument goes,would boost the
farming industry,political sovereignty and even the nation\'s
health.Sounds great---but how feasible is this vision?

According to a report on UK food production from the University of
Leeds,UK, 85 per cent of the country\'s total land area is associated
with meat and dairy production. That supplies 80 per cent of what is
consumed,so even covering the whole country in livestock farms wouldn\'t
allow us to cover all our meat and dairy needs.

There are many caveats to those figures,but they are still grave.To
become much more self-sufficient,the UK would need to drastically reduce
its consumption of animal foods,and probably also farm more
intensively---meaning fewer green fields and more factory-style
production

But switching to a mainly plant-based diet wouldn\'t help.There is a
good reason why the UK is dominated by animal husbandry:most of its
terrain doesn\'t have the right soil or climate to grow crops on a
commercial basis.Just 25 per cent of the country\'s land is suitable for
crop-growing,most of which is already occupied by arable fields. Even if
we converted all the suitable land to fields of fruit and veg---which
would involve taking out all the nature reserves and removing thousands
of people from their homes---we would achieve only a 30 per cent boost
in crop production.

Just 23 per cent of the fruit and vegetables consumed in the UK are
currently home-grown,so even with the most extreme measures we could
meet only 30 per cent of our fresh produce needs.That is before we look
for the space to grow the grains, sugars,seeds and oils that provide us
with the vast bulk of our current calorie intake.

We\'re fairly good at judging people based on first impressions,thin
slices of experience ranging from a glimpse of a photo to five-minute
interaction,and deliberation can be not only extraneous but intrusive.In
one study of the ability she called"thin slicing,"the late psychologist
Nalini Ambady asked participants to watch silent 10-second video clips
of professors and to rate the instructor\'s overall effectiveness.Their
ratings correlated strongly with students\'end-of-semester
ratings.Another set of participants had to count backward from 1,000 by
nines as they watched the clips,occupying their conscious working
memory.Their ratings were just as accurate,demonstrating the intuitive
nature of the social processing.

Critically,another group was asked to spend a minute writing down
reasons for their judgment,before giving the rating.Accuracy dropped
dramatically.Ambady suspected that deliberation focused them on vivid
but misleading cues,such as certain gestures or uterances,rather than
letting the complex interplay of subtle signals form a holistic
impression.She found similar interference when participants watched
15-second clips of pairs of people and judged whether they were
strangers,friends,or dating partners

Other research shows we\'re better at detecting deception from thin
slices when we rely on intuition instead of reflection."Its as if
you\'re driving a stick shif,"says Judith Hall,a psychologist at
Northeastern University,"and if you start thinking about it too much,you
can\'t remember what you\'re doing.But if you go on automatic
pilot,you\'re fine.Much of our social life is like that."

Thinking too much can also harm our ability to form preferences.College
students\' ratings of strawberry jams and college courses aligned better
with experts\'opinions when the students weren\'t asked to analyze their
rationale.And people made car-buying decisions that were both
objectively better and more personally satisfying when asked to focus on
their feelings rather than on details,but only if the decision was
complex--- when they had a lot of information to process.

Intuition\'s special powers are unleashed only in certain
circumstances.In one study, participants completed a battery of eight
tasks,including four that tapped reflective thinking (discerning
rules,comprehending vocabulary)and four that tapped intuition and
creativity (generating new products or figures of speech).Then they
rated the degree to which they had used intuition("gut
feelings,""hunches,""my heart").Use of their gut hurt their performance
on the first four tasks,as expected,and helped them on the
rest.Sometimes the heart is smarter than the head.

**Directions:**

Read the following text and answer the questions by choosing the most
suitable subheading from the list A-G for each numbered paragraph
(41-45).There are two extra subheadings which you do not need to
use.Mark your answers on the ANSWER SHEET.(10 points)

\[A\]Stay calm.

\[B\]Stay humble.

\[C\]Decide whether to wait.

\[D\]Be realistic about the risks. \[E\]Don\'t make judgements.

\[F\]Identify a shared goal.

\[G\]Ask permission to disagree.

> **How to disagree with someone more powerful than you**

Your boss proposes a new initiative you think won\'t work.Your senior
colleague outlines a project timeline you believe is unrealistic.What do
you say when you disagree with someone who has more power than you
do?How do you decide whether it\'s worth speaking up?And if you do,what
exactly should you say?Here\'s how to disagree with someone more
powerful than you.

> 41\.

You may decide it\'s best to hold off on voicing your opinion.Maybe you
haven\'t finished thinking the problem through,or you want to get a
clearer sense of what the group thinks.If you think other people are
going to disagree,too,you might want to gather your army first.People
can contribute experience or information to your thinking---all the
things that would make the disagreement stronger or more valid.It\'s
also a good idea to delay the conversation if you are in a meeting or
other public space. Discussing the issue in private will make the
powerful person feel less threatened.

> 42\.

Before you share your thoughts,think about what the powerful person
cares about---it may be the credibility of their team or getting a
project done on time.You\'re more likely to be heard ifyou can connect
your disagreement to a higher purpose.When you do speak up,don\'t assume
the link will be clear.Youll want to state it overtly, contextualizing
your statements so that you\'re seen not as a disagreeable subordinate
but

as a colleague who\'s trying to advance a common objective.The
discussion will then become more like a chess game than a boxing match.

This step may sound overly deferential,but it\'s a smart way to give the
powerful person psychological safety and control.You can say something
like,"I know we seem to be moving toward a first-quarter commitment
here.I have reasons to think that won\'t work.I\'d like to lay out my
reasoning.Would that be OK?"This gives the person a choice,allowing him
to verbally opt in.And,assuming he says yes,it will make you feel more
confident about voicing your disagreement.

You might feel your heart racing or your face turning red,but do
whatever you can to remain neutral in both your words and actions.When
your body language communicates reluctance or anxiety,it undercuts the
message.It sends a mixed message, and your counterpart gets to choose
what signals to read.Deep breaths can help,as can speaking more slowly
and deliberately.When we feel panicky,we tend to talk louder and
faster.Simply slowing the pace and talking in an even tone helps the
other person cool down and does the same for you.It also makes you seem
confident,even if you aren\'t.

Emphasize that you\'re only offering your opinion,not gospel truth.It
may be a well-informed,well-researched opinion,but it\'s still an
opinion,so talk tentatively and slightly understate your
confidence.Instead of saying:"If we set an end-of-quarter deadline,we
will never make it,"say,"This is just my opinion,but I don\'t see how we
will make that deadline."Having asserted your opinion (as a position,not
as a fact), demonstrate equal curiosity about other views.Remind the
person that this is your point of view,and then invite critique.Be open
to hearing other opinions.

**46.Directions:**

Translate the following text into Chinese.Write your translation on the
ANSWER SHEET.(15 points)

We tend to think that friends and family members are our biggest sources
of connection,laughter,and warmth.While that may well be
true,researchers have also recently found that interacting with
strangers actually brings a boost in mood and feelings of belonging that
we didn\'t expect.

In one series of studies,researchers instructed Chicago-area commuters
using public transportation to strike up a conversation with someone
near them.On average, participants who followed this instruction felt
better than those who had been told to stand or sit in silence.The
researchers also argued that when we shy away from casual interactions
with strangers,it is often due to a misplaced anxiety that they might
not want to talk to us.Much of the time,however,this belief is false.As
it turns out,many people are actually perfectly willing to talk---and
may even be flatered to receive your attention.
