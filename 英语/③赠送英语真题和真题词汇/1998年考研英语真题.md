Until recently most historians spoke very critically of the Industrial
Revolution. They 1 that in the long run industrialization greatly raised
the standard of living for the 2 man. But they insisted that its
[3]{.underline} results during the period from 1750 to 1850 were
widespread poverty and misery for the 4 of the English population. 5
contrast, they saw in the preceding hundred years from 1650 to 1750,
when England was still a 6 agricultural country, a period of great
abundance and prosperity.

This view, [7]{.underline} , is generally thought to be wrong.
Specialists [8]{.underline} history and economics, have\_\_2 two things:
that the period from 1650 to 1750 was \_\_lQ\_ by great poverty, and
that industrialization certainly did not worsen and may have actually
improved the conditions for the majority of the populace.

environmentalists concerned about uncontrolled industrial growth are
anti-science, as an essa~~y~~ in US News & World Report last May seemed
to suggest.

The environmentalists, inevitably, respond to such critics. The true
enemies of science, argues

They were, by far, the largest and most distant objects that scientists
had ever detected: a strip of enormous cosmic clouds some 15 billion
light-years from earth. 31) [But even more important, it

and structures that existed 15 billion years ago.]{.underline} That was
just about the moment that the universe was born. What the researchers
found was at once both amazing and expected: the US National Aeronautics
and Space Administration\'s Cosmic Background Explorer satellite \--
Cobe \-- had discovered landmark evidence that the universe did in fact
begin with the primeval explosion that has become known as the Big Bang
(the theory that the universe originated in an explosion from a single
mass of energy).
