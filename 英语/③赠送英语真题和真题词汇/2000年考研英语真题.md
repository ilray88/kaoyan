All of this caused a crisis of confidence. Americans stopped taking
prosperity for granted. They

beg~~an~~ to believe that their w~~a~~y of doing business was failing,
and th~~a~~t their incomes would therefore

shortly begin to fall as well.The mid-1980s brought one inquiry after

Certainly their descriptions of battles are confused. But it is a little
~~u~~psetting to read in the

explanatory notes that a certain line describes a fight between a
Turkish and a Bulgarian officer on a

bridge off which they both fall into the river -and then to find that
the line consists of the noise of

![](media/image37.jpeg){width="1.665573053368329e-3in"

Governments throughout the world act on the assumption that the welfare
of their people depends largely on the economic strength and wealth of
the community. 31 ) [Under modem conditions, this]{.underline} [requires
varying measures of centralized control and hence the help of
specialized scientists such as]{.underline} [economists and operational
research experts]{.underline}. 32 ) [Furthermore, it is obvious that the
strength of a]{.underline} [country\'s economy is directly bound up with
the efficiency of its agriculture and industry, and that
this]{.underline} [in tum rests upon the efforts of scientists and
technologists of all kinds]{.underline}. It also means that governments
are increasingly compelled to interfere in these sectors in order to
step up production and ensure that it is utilized to the best advantage.
For example, they may encourage research in various ways, including the
setting up of their own research centers; they may alter the structure
of education, or interfere in order to reduce the wastage of natural
resources or tap resources hitherto unexploited; or they may cooperate
directly in the growing number of international projects related to
science, economics and industry. In any case, all such interventions are
heavily dependent on scientific advice and also scientific and
technological manpower of all kinds.
