The human nose is an underrated tool. Humans are often thought to be
insensitive smellers compared with animals, [l]{.underline} this is
largely because, Lanimals,we stand upright. This means that our noses
are [3]{.underline} to perceiving those smells which float through the
air,\_±\_the majority of smells which stick to surfaces. In fact,
[5]{.underline} ,we are extremely sensitive to smells, [6]{.underline}
we do not generally realize it. Our noses are capable of\_\]\_human
smells even when these are\--8_to far below one part in one million.

Strangely, some people find that they can smell one type of flower but
not another[, 9]{.underline} others are sensitive to the smells of both
flowers. This may be because some people do not have the genes necessary
to generate_lQ\_ smell receptors in the nose. These receptors are the
cells which sense smells and send ll\_\_ to the brain. However,it has
been found that even people insensitive to a certain smell_l2.\_ can
suddenly become sensitive to it when_11_to it often enough.

![](media/image6.jpeg){width="1.0e-2in"
height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}In the world of capuchins grapes are
luxury goods (and much preferable to cucumbers). So when one monkey was
handed a grape in exchange for her token, the second was reluctant to
h~~an~~d hers over for a mere piece of cucumber. And if one received a
grape without having to provide her token in exchange at all, the other
either tossed her own token at the researcher or out of the chamber, or
refused to accept the slice of cucumber. Indeed, the mere presence of a
grape in the other chamber (without an actual monkey to eat it) was

To serve as responsible stewards of the planet,we must press forward on
deeper atmospheric and oceanic research. But research alone is
inadequate. If the Administration won\'t take the legislative
initiative,Congress should help to begin fashioning conservation
measures. A bill by Democratic Senator Robert Byrd of West
Virginia,which would offer financial incentives for private industry,is
a promising start. Many see that the country is getting ready to build
lots of new power plants to meet our energy needs. If we are ever going
to protect the atmosphere,it is crucial that those new plants be
environmentally sound.

![](media/image15.jpeg){width="0.16in"
height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}Of all the components of a goodnight\'s
sleep, dreams seem to be least within our

control. In dreams, a window opens into a world where logic is suspended
and dead

people speak. A ce~~ntur~~y ago, Freud formulated his revolutionary
theory that dreams

> were the disguised shadows of our unconscious desires and fears; by
> the late 1970s, neurologists had switched to thinking of them as just
> \"mental noise\" - the random

byproducts of the neural-repair work that goes on during sleep. Now
researchers

suspect that dreams are part of the mind\'s emotional thermostat,
regulating moods while the brain is \"off-line.\" And one leading
authority says that these intensely powerful mental events can be not
only harnessed but actually brought under

![](media/image16.jpeg){width="7.999890638670167e-2in"
height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}conscious control, to help us sleep and
feel better. \"It\'s your dream,\" says Rosalind

> C~~a~~rtwri~~g~~ht, chair of psychology at Chicago\'s Medical Center.
> \"If you don\'t like it,
>
> change it.\"

Evidence from brain imaging supports this vi~~e~~w. The brain is as
active during

REM (rapid eye movement) sleep - when most vivid dreams occur - as it is
when

![](media/image5.jpeg){width="6.833442694663167e-2in"
height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}fully awake, says Dr. Eric Nofzinger at
the University of Pittsburgh. But not all parts

![](media/image17.jpeg){width="1.1665573053368329e-2in"
height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}of the brain are equally involved; the
limbic system (the \"emotional brain\") is

> especially active, while the prefrontal cortex (the ce~~n~~ter of
> intellect ~~an~~d reasoning) is relatively quiet. \"We wake up from
> dreams happy or depressed, and those feelings can stay with us all
> day.\" says Stanford sleep researcher Dr. William Dement.

The link between dreams and emotions shows up among the patients in
C~~a~~rtwright\'s clinic. Most people seem to have more bad dreams early
in the night, progressing tow~~ard hap~~pier ones before awakening,
suggesting that they are working through negative feelings generated
during the day. Because our conscious mind is occupied with daily life
we don\'t always think about the emotional significance of the day\'s
eve~~n~~ts- u~~n~~til, it appears, we begin to dream.

> ![](media/image18.jpeg){width="6.833442694663167e-2in"
> height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}And this process need not be left to

At the end of the day, there\'s probably little reason to pay attention
to our dreams

height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}Terrorism, economic uncertainties and
general feelings of insecurity have increased

people\'s anxiety. Those suffering from persistent nightmares should
seek help from a therapist. For the rest of us, the brain has its ways
of working through bad feelings.

Premiers love to quote Mr. Romanow\'s report selectively, especially the
