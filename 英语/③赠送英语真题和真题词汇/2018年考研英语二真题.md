**Some growth stems from a commitment by governments and farsighted
businesses to fund cleaner energy sources. But increasingly the story is
about the plummeting prices of renewables, especially wind and solar.
The cost of solar panels has dropped by 80 percent and the cost of wind
turbines by close to one-third in the past eight years.**

**In many parts of the world renewable energy is already a principal
energy source. In Scotland, for example, wind turbines provide enough
electricity to power 95 percent of homes. While the rest of the world
takes the lead, notably China and Europe, the United States is also
seeing a remarkable shift. In March, for the first time, wind and solar
power accounted for more than 10 percent of the power generated in the
US, reported the US Energy Information Administration.**

**President Trump has underlined fossil fuels --- especially coal --- as
the path to economic growth. In a recent speech in Iowa, he dismissed
wind power as an unreliable energy source. But that message did not play
well with many in Iowa, where wind turbines dot the fields and provide
36 percent of the state\'s electricity generation - and where tech
giants like Microsoft are being attracted by the availability of clean
energy to power their data centers.**

**The advance is driven in part by vehicle manufacturers, who are
placing big bets on battery-powered electric vehicles. Although electric
cars are still a rarity on roads now, this massive investment could
change the picture rapidly in coming years.**

**While there\'s a long way to go, the trend lines for renewables are
spiking. The pace of change in energy sources appears to be speeding up

alternative energy may mean less and less at a time of a global shift in
thought.**
