**Unlike so-called basic emotions such as sadness, fear, and anger,
guilt emerges a little later, in conjunction with a child\'s growing
grasp of social and moral norms. Children aren\'t born knowing how to
say \"I\'m sorry\"; rather, they learn over time that such statements
appease parents and friends - and their own consciences. This is why
researchers generally regard so-called moralguilt, in the right amount,
to be a good thing.**

**In the popular imagination, of course, guilt still gets a bad rap. It
is deeply uncomfortable - it\'s the emotional equivalent of wearing a
jacket weighted with stones. Yet this understanding is outdated. \"There
has been a kind of revival or a rethinking about what guilt is and what
role guilt can serve,\" says Amrisha Yaish, a psychology researcher at
the University of Virginia, adding that this revival is part of a larger
recognition that emotions aren\'t binary --- feelings that may be
advantageous in one context may be harmful in another. Jealousy and
anger, for example, may have evolved to alert us to important
inequalities. Too much happiness can be destructive.**

> **And guilt, by prompting us to think more deeply about our goodness,
> can encourage humans to make up for errors and fix relationships.
> Guilt, in other words, can help hold a cooperative species together.
> It is a kind of social glue.**

**Viewed in this light, guilt is an opportunity. Work by Tina Malti, a
psychology professor at the University of Toronto, suggests that guilt
may compensate for an emotional deficiency. In a number of studies,
Malti and others have shown that guilt and sympathy may represent
different pathways to cooperation and sharing. Some kids who are low in
sympathy may make up for that shortfall by experiencing more guilt,
which can rein in their nastier impulses. And vice versa: High sympathy
can substitute for low guilt.**

> **In a 2014 study, for example, Malti looked at 244 children. Using
> caregiver assessments and the children\'s self-observations, she rated
> each child\'s overall sympathy level and his or her tendency to feel
> negative emotions after moral transgressions. Then the kids were
> handed chocolate coins, and given a chance to share them with an
> anonymous child. For the low-sympathy kids, how much they shared
> appeared to tum on how inclined they were to feel guilty. The
> guilt-prone ones shared more, even though they hadn\'t magically
> become more sympathetic to the other child\'s deprivation.**

> caused harm and we feel regret.\"**

**Thankfully, there is a way out of this trap --- but it involves
striking a subtle balance. Helping forests flourish as valuable \"carbon
sinks\" long into the future may require reducing their capacity to
absorb carbon now. California is leading the way, as it does on so many
climate efforts, in figuring out the details.**

writer James Herriot. He had such a pleasant, readable style that one
mi~~g~~ht think that anyone could imit~~a~~te it. How many times have I
heard people say, \"I could write a book. I just haven\'t the time.\"
Easily said. Not so easily done. James Herriot, contrary to popular
opinion, did not find it easy in his early days of, as he put it,
\"having a go at the writing game\". While he obviously had an abundance
of natural talent, the final, polished work that he gave to the world
was the result of years of practicing, re-writing and reading. Like the
majority of authors, he had to suffer many disappointme~~nts an~~d
rejections along the way, but these made him all the more determined to
succeed. Everything he achieved in life was earned the hard way and his
success in the literary field was no exception.**
