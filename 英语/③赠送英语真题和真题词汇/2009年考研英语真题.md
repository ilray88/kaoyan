Most tests require collecting cells by swabbing saliva in the mouth and
sending it

![](media/image4.jpeg){width="1.0e-2in"

But some observers are skeptical. \"There\'s a kind of false precision
being hawked by people claiming they are doing ancestry testing,\" says
Troy Duster, a New York University sociologist. He notes that each
individual has many ancestors - numbering in the hundreds just a few
centuries back. Yet most ancestry testing only considers a single
lineage, either the Y chromosome inherited through men in a father\'s
line or mitochondrial DNA, which is passed down only from mothers. This
DNA can reveal genetic information about only one or two ancestors, even
though, for example, just three generations back people also have six
other great-grandparents or, four generations back, 14 other
great-great-grandparents.

What is the real relationship between education and economic
development? We have to suspect that continuing economic growth promotes
the development of education even when governments don\'t force it.
After all, that\'s how education got started. When our ancestors were
hunters and gatherers 10, 000 years ago, they didn\'t have time to
wonder much about anything besides finding food. Only when hum~~an~~ity
began to get its food in a more productive way was there time for other
things.

31\. The a~~u~~thor holds in Paragraph 1 that the importance of
education in poor countries

> \[C\] is co~~nven~~tionally downgraded. \[D\] has been overestimated.

32\. It is stated in Paragraph 1 that the construction of a new
educational system

33.A major difference between the Japanese and U.S. workforces is that
\[A\] the Japanese workforce is better disciplined.

Boas felt that the culture of any society must be understood as the
result of a unique history and not as one of many cultures belonging to
a broader evolution~~ar~~y stage or type of culture. (44)

Also in the early 1900s, French sociologist Emile Durkheim developed a
theory of culture that would greatly influence anthropology. Durkheim
proposed that religious beliefs functioned to reinforce social
solidarity. An interest in the relationship between the function of
society and culture became a major theme in European, and especially
British, anthropology.

There is a marked difference between the education which every one gets
from living with others and the deliberate educating of the young. In
the former case the education is incidental; it is natural and
important, but it is not the express reason of the association. (46) [It
may be said that the measure of the worth of any social]{.underline}
[institution is its effect in enlarging and improving experience, but
this effect is not a]{.underline} [part of its original
motive]{.underline}. Religious associations began, for example, in the
desire to secure the favor of overruling powers and to ward off evil
influences; family life in the desire to gratify appetites and secure
family perpetuity; systematic labor, for the most part, because of
enslavement to others, etc. (47) [Only gradually was the]{.underline}
QY:­ [product of the institution noted, and only more gradually still was
this effect]{.underline} [considered as a directive factor in the
conduct of the institution]{.underline}. Even today, in our industrial
life, apart from certain values of industriousness and thrift, the
intellectual and emotional reaction of the forms of human association
under which the world\' s work is carried on receives little attention
as compared with physical output.

> But in dealing with the young, the fact of association itself as an
> immediate

human fact, gains in importance. (48) [While it is easy to ignore in our
contact with]{.underline} [them the effect of our acts upon their
disposition, it is not so easy as in dealing with]{.underline}
[adults]{.underline}. The need of training is too evident and the
pressure to accomplish a change in their attitude and habits is too
urgent to leave these consequences wholly out of account. (49) [Since
our chief business with them is to enable them to share in
a]{.underline} [common life we cannot help considering whether or not we
are forming the powers]{.underline} [which will secure this
ability]{.underline}. If humanity has made some headway in realizing
that the ultimate value of every institution is its distinctively human
effect we may well believe that this lesson has been learned largely
through dealings with theyoung.
