Here's a common scenario that any number of entrepreneurs face today:
you're the CEO of a small business and though you're making a nice
[1]{.underline} , you need to ﬁnd a way to take it to the next level.
what you need to do is [2]{.underline} growth by establishing a growth
team. A growth team is made up of members from different departments
within your company, and it harnesses the power of collaboration to
focus [3]{.underline} on ﬁnding ways to grow.

Let's look at a real-world [4]{.underline} . Prior to forming a growth
team, the software company BitTorrent had 50 employees. Working in the
[5]{.underline} . departments of engineering, marketing and product
development. This brought them good results until 2012, when their
growth plateaued. The [6]{.underline} . was that too many customers were
using the basic, free version of their product. And [7]{.underline} .
improvements to the premium, paid version, few people were making the
upgrade.

> Things changed, [8]{.underline} , when an innovative project marketing
> manager came aboard, [9]{.underline} a growth team and sparked the

> engineering issues from a marketing point of view, it became clear
> that the [11]{.underline} of upgrades wasn't due to a quality issue.
> Most customers were simply unaware of the premium version and what it
> oﬀered.

Armed with this [12]{.underline} , the marketing and engineering teams
joined forces to raise awareness by prominently [13]{.underline} the
premium version to users of the free version. [14]{.underline} ,
upgrades skyrocketed, and revenue increased by 92 percent. But in order
for your growth, team to succeed, it needs to a have a strong leader. It
needs someone who can [15]{.underline} the interdisciplinary team and
keep them on course for improvement. This leader will [16]{.underline}
the target area, set clear goals and establish a time frame for the
[17]{.underline} of these goals.

> [19]{.underline} attractive, new ideas can be distracting, the team

has banned fake grass from this year's event, declaiming it to be not
part of its ethos. The Royal

> 英语（二）试题 .3. （共14 页）

Horticultural Society (RHS), which runs the annual show in west London,
says it has introduced the ban because of the damage plastic grass does
to the environment and biodiversity.

Ed Horne, of the RHS, said: "We launched our sustainability strategy
last year and fake grass is just not in line with our ethos and views on
plastic. We recommend using real grass because of its environment
beneﬁts, which include supporting wildlife, alleviating, ﬂooding and
cooling the environment.

> have gathered 7,276 and 11,282 signatures.

However, supporters of fake grass point out that there's also an
environmental impact with natural lawns, which need mowing and therefore
usually consume electricity or petrol. The industry also points out that
real grass requires considerable amounts of water, weed killer or other
treatments and that people who lay fake grass tend to use their garden
more. The industry also claims that people who lay fake grass spend an
average of £500 on trees or shrubs for their garden, which provides
habitat for insects.

> In response to another petition last year about banning fake lawns,
> which gathered 30,000 signatures, the government responded that it has
> "no plans to ban the use of artiﬁcial grass."

It added: "We prefer to help people and organizations make the right
choice rather than legislating on such matters. However, the use of
artificial grass must comply with the legal and policy safeguards in
place to protect biodiversity and ensure sustainable drainage, while
measures such as the strengthened biodiversity duty should serve to
encourage public authorities to consider sustainable alternatives."

It's easy to dismiss as absurd the federal government's ideas for
plugging the chronic funding gap of our national parks. Can anyone
really think it's a good idea to allow Amazon deliveries to your tent in
Yosemite or food trucks to line up under the redwood trees at Sequoia
National Park?

But the administration is right about one thing: U.S. national parks are
in crisis. Collectively, they have a maintenance backlog of more than
\$12 billion. Roads, trails, restrooms, visitor centers and other
infrastructure are crumbling.

> But privatizing and commercializing the campgrounds would not be the
> cure-all. Campgrounds are a tiny portion of the overall infrastructure
> backlog, and business in the parks hand over, on average, only about
> 5% of their revenues to the National Park Service.

Moreover, increased privatization would certainly undercut one of the
major reasons why 300 million visitors come to the parks each year: to
enjoy nature and get a respite from the commercial drumbeat that
overwhelms daily life.

> 英语（二）试题 .5. （共14 页）

The real problem is that the parks have been chronically starved of
funding. We conducted a comprehensive survey examining how U.S.
residents view their national parks, and we found that Americans place a
very high value on them --- whether or not they actually visit them. The
peer- reviewed economic survey of 700 U.S. taxpayers, conducted by mail
and internet, also found that people would be willing to pay a
significant amount of money to make sure the parks and their programs
are kept intact. Some 81% of respondents said they would be willing to
pay additional taxes for the next 10 years to avoid any cuts to the
national parks.

> places to escape and as symbols of nature. On top of this, they
> produce value from their extensive educational programs, their
> positive impact on the climate through carbon sequestration, their
> contribution to our cultural and artistic life, and of course through
> tourism.

The parks also help keep America's past alive, working with thousands of
local jurisdictions around the country to protect historical sites and
to bring the stories of these places to life. The parks do all this on a
shoestring. Congress allocates only \$3 billion a year to the national
park system --- an amount that has been ﬂat since 2001 (in
inﬂation-adjusted dollars) with the exception of a onetime boost in
2009. Meanwhile, the number of annual visitors has increased by more
than 50% since 1980, and now stands at 330 million visitors per year.

The Internet may be changing merely what we remember, not our capacity
to do so, suggests Columbia University psychology professor Betsy
Sparrow. In 2011, Sparrow led a study in which participants were asked
to record 40 factoids in a computer ("an ostrich's eye is bigger than
its brain," for example). Half of the participants were told the
information would be erased, while the other half were told it would be
saved. Guess what? The latter group made no eﬀort to recall the
information when quizzed on it later, because they knew they could ﬁnd
it on their computers. In the same study, a group was asked to remember
both the information and the folders it was stored in. They didn't
remember the information, but they remembered how to find the folders.
In other words, human memory is not deteriorating but "adapting to new
communications technology," Sparrow says.

> In a very practical way, the Internet is becoming an external hard
> drive for our memories, a process known as "cognitive offloading."
> Traditionally, this role was fulfilled by data banks, libraries, and
> other humans. Your father may never remember birthdays because your
> mother does, for instance. Some worry that this is having a

> thinking - something that is not available on the Internet. "I
> personally have never seen all that much intellectual value in
> memorizing things," Sparrow says, adding that we haven't lost our
> ability to do it.

Still other experts say it's too soon to understand how the Internet
affects our brains. There is no experimental evidence showing that it
interferes with our ability to focus, for instance, wrote psychologists
Christopher Chabris and Daniel J. Simons. And surﬁng the web exercised
the brain more than reading did among computer-savvy older adults in a
2008 study involving 24 participants at the Semel Institute for
Neuroscience and Human Behavior at the University of California, Los
Angeles.

Teenagers are paradoxical. That 's a mild and detached way of saying
something that parents often express with considerably stronger
language. But the paradox is scientific as well as personal.In
adolescence, helpless and dependent children who have relied on grown-

ups for just about everything become independent people who can take
care of themselves

> 英语（二）试题 .8. （共14 页）

and help each other. At the same time,once cheerful and compliant
children become rebellious teenage risk-takers.

A new study published in the journal Child Development, by Eveline Crone
of the University of Leiden and colleagues,suggests that the positive
and negative sides of teenagers go hand in hand. The study is part of a
new wave of thinking about adolescence. For a long time,scientists and
policy makers concentrated on the idea that teenagers were a problem
that needed to be solved. The new work emphasizes that adolescence is a
time of opportunity as well as risk.

The researchers studied "prosocial" and rebellious traits in more than
200children and young adults, ranging from 11 to 28 years old. The
participants ﬁlled out questionnaires about how often they did things
that were altruistic and positive, like sacriﬁcing their own interests
to help a friend, or rebellious and negative,like getting drunk or
staying out late.

Other studies have shown that rebellious behavior increases as you
become a teenager and then fades away as you grow older. But the new
study shows that, interestingly, the same pattern holds for prosocial
behavior. Teenagers were more likely than younger children or adults to
report that they did things like unselﬁshlyhelp a friend.

> Most significantly, there was a positive correlation between
> prosociality and rebelliousness. The teenagers who were more
> rebellious were also more likely to help others. The good and bad
> sides of adolescence seem to develop together.

Is there some common factor that underlies these apparently
contradictory developments? One idea is that teenage behavior is related
to what researchers call "reward sensitivity." Decision- making always
involves balancing rewards and risks,benefits and costs. "Reward
sensitivity" measures how much reward it takes to outweigh risk.

New building regulations aimed at improving energy eﬃciency are set to
increase the price of new homes, as well as those of extensions and loft
conversions on existing ones.

The changes could mean an extra £3,000 added to the bill of an average
home extension, according to Jonathan Rolande of the National
Association of Property Buyers, a group of professionals aimed at
raising construction standards.

Homeowners extending may see the amount of space they have decrease, as
walls will have to be thicker in order to comply with requirements for
better insulation.

Andrew Mellor, of PRP architects, says external walls will need to be
about 7cm thicker than previously.

> Thomas Goodman, of MyJobQuote, a site which sources quotes, says this

"Glazing on windows, doors and rooﬂights must cover no more than 25% of
the ﬂoor area to prevent heat loss, " he says.

> "We'll see more insulation, better lighting design and restrictions on

> double-glazed windows will require trickle vents to let heat escape
> and also to provide fresh air for health reasons and, of course, to
> reduce the risk of condensation build up in an ever-more airtight
> property."

As the rules came into eﬀect last Wednesday, property developers were
rushing to ﬁle plans just before the deadline, according to Belsham. Any
plans submitted before that date are considered to be under the previous
rules, and can go ahead as long as work starts before 15 June next year.

The measures are part of government plans to reduce carbon emissions as
part of its bid to make the UK net zero by 2050. Last week's rule
changes apply to England. Scotland and Wales brought in similar changes
recently.

No one knows for sure when poetry began but it has been around for
thousands of years, even before people could write. It was a way to tell
stories and pass down history. It is closely related to song and even
when written it is usually created to be performed out loud. Poems
really come to life when they are recited. This can also help with
understanding them too, because the rhythm and sounds of the words
become clearer.
