Until recently most historians spoke very critically of the Industrial
Revolution. They 1 that in the long run industrialization greatly raised
the standard of living for the 2 man. But they insisted that its
[3]{.underline} results during the period from 1750 to 1850 were
widespread poverty and misery for the 4 of the English population. 5
contrast, they saw in the preceding hundred years from 1650 to 1750,
when England was still a 6 agricultural country, a period of great
abundance and prosperity.

This view, [7]{.underline} , is generally thought to be wrong.
Specialists [8]{.underline} history and economics, have\_\_2 two things:
that the period from 1650 to 1750 was \_\_lQ\_ by great poverty, and
that industrialization certainly did not worsen and may have actually
improved the conditions for the majority of the populace.

environmentalists concerned about uncontrolled industrial growth are
anti-science, as an essa~~y~~ in US News & World Report last May seemed
to suggest.

The environmentalists, inevitably, respond to such critics. The true
enemies of science, argues

They were, by far, the largest and most distant objects that scientists
had ever detected: a strip of enormous cosmic clouds some 15 billion
light-years from earth. 31) [But even more important, it

into the past, for what they were seeing were the]{.underline} [patterns
and structures that existed 15 billion years ago.]{.underline} That was
just about the moment that the universe was born. What the researchers
found was at once both amazing and expected: the US National Aeronautics
and Space Administration\'s Cosmic Background Explorer satellite \--
Cobe \-- had discovered landmark evidence that the universe did in fact
begin with the primeval explosion that has become known as the Big Bang
(the theory that the universe originated in an explosion from a single
mass of energy).

working to keep them [2]{.underline} and active. When the work is well
done, a 3 of accident free operations is established 4 time lost due to
injuries is kept at a minimum.

Successful safety programs may [5]{.underline} greatly in the emphasis
placed on certain aspects of the program. Some place great emphasis on
mechanical guarding. Others stress safe work practices by
[6]{.underline} rules or regulations. 7 others depend on an emotional
appeal to the worker. But, there are certain basic ideas that must be
used in every program if maximum results are to be obtained.

Feeling threatened, compames responded by writing ever longer wammg

Now the tide appears to be turning. As personal injury claims continue
as before, some co~~u~~rts are

![](media/image30.jpeg){width="0.158332239720035in"
height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}begi~~nn~~ing to side with defendants,
especially in cases where a warning label probably wouldn\'t have

changed anything. In May, Julie Nimmons, president of Sch~~u~~tt Sports

In the first year or so of Web business, most of the action has revolved
a~~round effo~~rts to tap the

consumer market. More recently, as the Web proved to be more than a
fashion, companies have started

to buy ~~an~~d sell products and services with one ~~an~~other. Such
business to business sales make sense

because businesspeople typically know ~~w~~hat product they\'re looking
for.

Nonetheless, m~~an~~y co~~mpan~~ies still hesitate to use the Web
because of doubts ~~a~~bout its reli~~a~~bility.

> \"Businesses need to feel they can trust the pathway between them

analyst Blane Erwin of Forrester Research. Some companies are
li~~m~~iting the risk by conducting online

![](media/image35.jpeg){width="7.999890638670167e-2in"
height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}transactions only with established
business partners who are given access to the company\'s private

Another major shift in the model for Internet commerce concerns the
technology available for

marketing. Until rece~~n~~tly, Internet marketing activities have
focused on strategies to \"pull\" customers

into sites. In the past year, however, software companies ha~~v~~e
developed tools that allow companies to

\"push\" information directly out to consumers, t~~ran~~smitting
m~~ar~~keting messages directly to targeted

customers. Most notably, the Pointcast Network uses a screen sa~~v~~er
to deliver a continually ~~u~~pdated

stream of news and advertisements to subscribers\' co~~mp~~uter
monitors. Subscribers c~~an~~ custo~~m~~ize the

![](media/image35.jpeg){width="7.999890638670167e-2in"
height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}information they want to receive and
proceed directly to a company\'s Web site. Companies such as

Web users. Online culture thinks hi~~g~~hly of the notion th~~a~~t the
information flowing onto the screen

comes there by specific request. Once commercial promotion begins to
fill the screen unin~~v~~ited, the

B~~u~~t it is hardly inevitable that companies on the Web will need to
resort to push strategies to

![](media/image38.jpeg){width="7.999890638670167e-2in"
height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}make money. The examples of Virtual
Vineyards, Amazon .corn, and other pioneers show that a Web

height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}site selling the ri~~g~~ht kind of
products with the ri~~g~~ht mix of interactivity, hospitality, ~~an~~d
security will

attract online customers. And the cost of comp~~u~~ting power continues
to free fall, ~~w~~hich is a good sign

When a Scottish research team startled the world by revealing 3 months
ago th~~a~~t it had cloned ~~an~~

![](media/image50.jpeg){width="7.999890638670167e-2in"
height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}adult sheep, President Clinton moved
swiftly. Declaring that he was opposed to using this ~~unu~~sual

![](media/image64.jpeg){width="3.666557305336833e-2in"
height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}~~an~~imal husbandry technique to clone
humans, he ordered th~~a~~t federal funds not be used for such ~~an~~

e~~x~~periment-although no one had proposed to do so-and asked an
independent panel of e~~x~~perts

chaired by Princeton Preside~~n~~t H~~aro~~ld Shapiro to report back to
the White House in 90 d~~a~~ys with

recommendations for a national policy on human cloning. That gro~~u~~p -
the National Bioethics

Advisory Co~~mm~~ission (NBAC)-has been wo~~r~~king feverishly to put
its wisdom on paper, ~~an~~d at a

> meeting on 17 May, members agreed on a near final draft of their
> recommendations.

NBAC will ask that Clinton \' s 90 d~~a~~y b~~an~~ on federal funds for
human cloning be extended

indefinitely, and possibly that it be made la~~w~~. But NBAC members are
planning to word the

recommendation narrowly to avoid new restrictions on rese~~ar~~ch that
involves the cloning of hum~~an~~

DNA or cells~~-rou~~tine in molecular biology. The panel has not yet
reached agreement on a crucial

question,however, whether to recommend legislation that would
m![](media/image65.jpeg){width="0.0in" height="1.665573053368329e-3in"}
akeit a crime for private funding to

be used for h~~u~~man cloning.

![](media/image66.jpeg){width="0.10500109361329833in"
height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}In a d~~ra~~ft preface to the
reco~~mm~~end~~a~~tions, discussed at the 17 May meeting, Shapiro
suggested

that the panel had found a broad consensus that it would be \"morally
~~u~~nacceptable to attempt to create

> a human child by adult ~~n~~uclear cloning.\" Shapiro explained

NBAC plans to call for a contin~~u~~ed ban on federal government funding
for ![](media/image67.jpeg){width="1.665573053368329e-3in"
height="1.5e-2in"}any

height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}NBAC me~~m~~bers also indicated th~~a~~t
they would appeal to privately funded rese~~ar~~chers ~~an~~d clinics

not to try to clone humans by body cell nuclear transfer. But they were

How many men would have considered the possibility of an apple falling
u~~p in~~to the tree?

Newton did because he was not trying to predict ~~an~~ything. He was
just wondering. His mind was ready

for the unpredictable. Unpredictability is part of the essential nature
of research. If you don\'t have

What this amounts to, of course, is that the scientist has become the
victim of his o~~wn w~~ritings.

31\) [While there are almost as many definitions of history as there are
historians, modem practice]{.underline} [most closely conforms to one
that sees history as the attempt to recreate and explain the
significant]{.underline} [events of the past.]{.underline} Caught in the
web of its own time and place, each generation of historians determines
anew what is significant for it in the past. In this search the evidence
found is always incomplete and scattered; it is also frequently partial
or partisan. The irony of the historian\'s craft is that its
practitioners always know that their efforts are but contributions to an
unending process.

32 ) [Interest in historical methods has arisen less through external
challenge to the validity of]{.underline} [history as an intellectual
discipline and more from internal quarrels among historians
themselves.]{.underline} While history once revered its affinity to
literature and philosophy, the emerging social sciences seemed to afford
greater opportunities for asking new questions and providing rewarding
approaches to an understanding of the past. Social science methodologies
had to be adapted to a discipline governed by the primacy of historical
sources rather than the imperatives of the contemporary world. 33)
[During this transfer, traditional historical methods were augmented by
additional methodologies]{.underline} [designed to interpret the new
forms of evidence in the historical study.]{.underline}

Methodology is a term that remains inherently ambiguous in the
historical profession. 34) [There]{.underline} [is no agreement whether
methodology refers to the concepts peculiar to historical work in
general or to]{.underline} [the research techniques appropriate to the
various branches of historical inquiry.]{.underline} Historians,
especially those so blinded by their research interests that they have
been accused of \"tunnel method,\" frequently fall victim to the
\"technical fallacy.\" Also common in the natural sciences, the
technicist fallacy mistakenly identifies the discipline as a whole with
certain parts of its technical implementation.

All of this caused a crisis of confidence. Americans stopped taking
prosperity for granted. They

beg~~an~~ to believe that their w~~a~~y of doing business was failing,
and th~~a~~t their incomes would therefore

shortly begin to fall as well.The mid-1980s brought one inquiry after

Certainly their descriptions of battles are confused. But it is a little
~~u~~psetting to read in the

explanatory notes that a certain line describes a fight between a
Turkish and a Bulgarian officer on a

bridge off which they both fall into the river -and then to find that
the line consists of the noise of

Governments throughout the world act on the assumption that the welfare
of their people depends largely on the economic strength and wealth of
the community. 31 ) [Under modem conditions, this]{.underline} [requires
varying measures of centralized control and hence the help of
specialized scientists such as]{.underline} [economists and operational
research experts]{.underline}. 32 ) [Furthermore, it is obvious that the
strength of a]{.underline} [country\'s economy is directly bound up with
the efficiency of its agriculture and industry, and that
this]{.underline} [in tum rests upon the efforts of scientists and
technologists of all kinds]{.underline}. It also means that governments
are increasingly compelled to interfere in these sectors in order to
step up production and ensure that it is utilized to the best advantage.
For example, they may encourage research in various ways, including the
setting up of their own research centers; they may alter the structure
of education, or interfere in order to reduce the wastage of natural
resources or tap resources hitherto unexploited; or they may cooperate
directly in the growing number of international projects related to
science, economics and industry. In any case, all such interventions are
heavily dependent on scientific advice and also scientific and
technological manpower of all kinds.

Specialisation can be seen as a response to the problem of an increasing
accumulation of scientific knowledge. By splitting up the subject matter
into smaller units ，one man could continue to handle the information
and use it as the basis for further research. But specialisation was
only one of a series of related developments in science affecting the
process of communication. Another was the growing professionalisation of
scientific activity.

A comparison of British geological publications over the last century
and a half reveals not simply an increasing emphasis on the primacy of
research, but also a changing definition of what constitutes an
acceptable research paper. Thus, in the nineteenth century, local
geological studies represented worthwhile research in their own right;
but, in the twentieth century, local studies have increasingly become
acceptable to professionals only if they incorporate, and reflect on,
the wider geological picture. Amateurs, on the other hand, have
continued to pursue local studies in the old way. The overall result has
been to make entrance to professional geological journals harder for
amateurs, a result that has been reinforced by the widespread
introduction of refereeing, first by national journals in the nineteenth
century and then by several local geological journals in the twentieth
century. As a logical consequence of this development, separate journals
have now appeared aimed mainly towards either professional or amateur
readership. A rather similar process of differentiation has led to
professional geologists coming together nationally within one or two
specific societies, whereas the amateurs have tended either to remain in
local societies or to come together nationally in a different way.

There are technological reasons to hope the digital divide will narrow.
As the Internet becomes more and more commercialized, it is in the
interest of business to universalize access-after all, the more people
online, the more potential customers there are. More and more
governments, afraid their countries will be left behind, want to spread
Internet access. Within the next decade or two, one to two billion
people on the planet will he netted together. As a result, I now believe
the digital divide will narrow rather than widen in the years ahead. And
that is very good news because the Internet may well be the most
powerful tool for combating world poverty that we've ever had.

To take advantage of this tool, some impoverished countries will have to
get over their outdated anti-colonial prejudices with respect to foreign
investment. Countries that still think foreign investment is an invasion
of their sovereignty might well study the history of infrastructure（the
basic structural foundations of a society）in the United States. When
the United States built its industrial infrastructure, it didn't have
the capital to do so. And that is why America's Second Wave
infrastructure-including roads, harbors, highways, ports and so on-were
built with foreign investment. The English, the Germans, the Dutch and
the French were investing in Britain's former colony. They financed
them. Immigrant Americans built them. Guess who owns them now? The
Americans. I believe the same thing would be true in places like Brazil
or anywhere else for that matter. The more foreign capital you have
helping you build your Third Wave infrastructure, which today is an
electronic infrastructure, the better off you're going to be. That
doesn\'t mean lying down and becoming fooled, or letting foreign
corporations run uncontrolled. But it does mean recognizing how
important they can be in building the energy and telecom infrastructures
needed to take full advantage of the Internet.

Why do so many Americans distrust what they read in their newspapers?
The American Society of Newspaper Editors is trying to answer this
painful question. The organization is deep into a long self-analysis
known as the journalism credibility project.

Examples of benefits or costs of the current concentration wave are
scanty. Yet it is hard to imagine that the merger of a few oil firms
today could re-create the same threats to competition that were feared
nearly a century ago in the U.S., when the Standard Oil trust was broken
up. The mergers of telecom companies, such as WorldCom, hardly seem to
bring higher prices for consumers or a reduction in the pace of
technical progress. On the contrary, the price of communications is
coming down fast. In cars, too, concentration is increasing-witness
Daimler and Chrysler, Renault and Nissan-but it does not appear that
consumers are being hurt.

When I decided to quit my full time employment it never occurred to me
that I might become a part of a new international trend. A lateral move
that hurt my pride and blocked my professional progress prompted me to
abandon my relatively high profile career although, in the manner of a
disgraced government minister, I covered my exit by claiming "I wanted
to spend more time with my family" .

I have discovered, as perhaps Kelsey will after her much-publicized
resignation from the editorship of She after a build-up of stress, that
abandoning the doctrine of "juggling your life", and making the
alternative move into "downshifting" brings with it far greater rewards
than financial success and social status. Nothing could persuade me to
return to the kind of life Kelsey used to advocate and I once enjoyed:
12-hour working days, pressured deadlines, the fearful strain of office
politics and the limitations of being a parent on "quality time" .

In less than 30 years ' time the Star Trek holodeck will be a reality.
Direct links between the brain's nervous system and a computer will also
create full sensory virtual environments, allowing virtual vacations
like those in the film Total Recall.

Through his research, Pearson is able to put dates to most of the
breakthroughs that can be predicted. However, there are still no
forecasts for when faster-than-light travel will be available, or when
human cloning will be perfected, or when time travel will be possible.
But he does expect social problems as a result of technological
advances. A boom in neighborhood surveillance cameras will, for example,
cause problems in 2010, while the arrival of synthetic lifelike robots
will mean people may not be able to distinguish between their human
friends and the droids.

If you intend using humor in your talk to make people smile, you must
know how to identify shared experiences and problems. Your humor must be
relevant to the audience and should help to show them that you are one
of them or that you understand their situation and are in sympathy with
their point of view. Depending on whom you are addressing, the problems
will be different. If you are talking to a group of managers, you may
refer to the disorganized methods of their secretaries; alternatively if
you are addressing secretaries, you may want to comment on their
disorganized bosses. Here is an example, which I heard at a nurses'
convention, of a story which works well because the audience all shared
the same view of doctors. A man arrives in heaven and is being shown
around by St. Peter. He sees wonderful accommodations, beautiful
gardens, sunny weather, and so on.

> Everyone is very peaceful, polite and friendly until, waiting in a
> line for lunch, the new arrival is suddenly pushed aside by a man in a
> white coat, who rushes to the head of the line, grabs his food and
> stomps over to a table by himself. "Who is that?" the new arrival
> asked St. Peter. "Oh, that's God," came the reply, "but sometimes he
> thinks he's a doctor."

If you are part of the group which you are addressing, you will be in a
position to know the experiences and problems which are common to all of
you and it'll be appropriate for you to make a passing remark about the
inedible canteen food or the chairman's notorious bad taste in ties.
With other audiences you mustn't attempt to cut in with humor as they
will resent an outsider making disparaging remarks about their canteen
or their chairman. You will be on safer ground if you stick to
scapegoats like the Post Office or the telephone system.

Look for the humor. It often comes from the unexpected. A twist on a
familiar quote "If at first you don't succeed, give up" or a play on
words or on a situation. Search for exaggeration and understatement.
Look at your talk and pick out a few words or sentences which you can
turn about and inject with humor.

As a result, the modern world is increasingly populated by intelligent
[gizmos]{.underline} whose presence we barely notice but whose universal
existence has removed much human labor. Our factories hum to the rhythm
of robot assembly arms. Our banking is done at automated teller
terminals that thank us with mechanical politeness for the transaction.
Our subway trains are controlled by tireless robot-drivers. And thanks
to the continual miniaturization of electronics and micro-mechanics,
there are already robot systems that can perform some kinds of brain and
bone surgery with submillimeter accuracy --- far greater precision than
highly skilled physicians can achieve with their hands alone.

What they found, in attempting to model thought, is that the human
brain\'s roughly one hundred billion nerve cells are much more talented
--- and human perception far more complicated --- than previously
imagined. They have built robots that can recognize the error of a
machine panel by a fraction of a millimeter in a controlled factory
environment. But the human mind can glimpse a rapidly changing scene and
immediately disregard the 98 percent that is irrelevant, instantaneously
focusing on the monkey at the side of a winding forest road or the
single suspicious face in a big crowd. The most advanced computer
systems on Earth can\'t approach that kind of ability, and
neuroscientists still don't know quite how we do it.

Could the bad old days of economic decline be about to return? Since
OPEC agreed to supply-cuts in March, the price of crude oil has jumped
to almost \$26 a barrel, up from less than \$10 last December. This
near-tripling of oil prices calls up scary memories of the 1973 oil
shock, when prices quadrupled, and 1979-1980, when they also almost
tripled. Both previous shocks resulted in double-digit inflation and
global economic decline. So where are the headlines warning of gloom and
doom this time?

> oil exports. Strengthening economic growth, at the same time as winter

> the short term.

Yet there are good reasons to expect the economic consequences now to be
less severe than in the 1970s. In most countries the cost of crude oil
now accounts for a smaller share of the price of petrol than it did in
the 1970s. In Europe, taxes account for up to four-fifths of the retail
price, so even quite big changes in the price of crude have a more muted
effect on pump prices than in the past.

Although it ruled that there is no constitutional right to
physician-assisted suicide, the Court in effect supported the medical
principle of "double effect", a centuries-old moral principle holding
that an action having two effects --- a good one that is intended and a
harmful one that is foreseen---is permissible if the actor intends only
the good effect.

> intend to kill their patients, although they risked their death. If
> you're a physician, you can *risk* your patient's suicide as long as
> you don't *intend* their suicide."

On another level, many in the medical community acknowledge that the
assisted-suicide debate has been fueled in part by the despair of
patients for whom modern medicine has prolonged the physical agony of
dying.

Just three weeks before the Court's ruling on physician-assisted
suicide, the National Academy of Science (NAS) released a two-volume
report, *Approaching Death: Improving Care at the End of Life*. It
identifies the undertreatment of pain and the [aggressive]{.underline}
use of "ineffectual and forced medical procedures that may prolong and
even dishonor the period of dying" as the twin problems of end-of-life
care.

Almost all our major problems involve human behavior, and they cannot be
solved by physical and biological technology alone. What is needed is a
technology of behavior, but we have been slow to develop the science
from which such a technology might be drawn.（41）[One difficulty is
that almos]{.underline}t [all of what is called behavioral science
continues to trace behavior to states of mind, feelings, traits
o]{.underline}f [character, human nature, and so on]{.underline}.
Physics and biology once followed similar practices and advanced only
when they discarded them. （ 42 ） [The behavioral sciences have been
slow to change partl]{.underline}y [because the explanatory items often
seem to be directly observed and partly because other kinds
o]{.underline}f [explanations have been hard to find.]{.underline} The
environment is obviously important, but its role has remained obscure.

Wild Bill Donovan would have loved the Internet. The American spymaster
who built the Office of Strategic Services in the World War II and later
laid the roots for the CIA was fascinated with information. Donovan
believed in using whatever tools came to hand in the \"great game\" of
espionage -spying as a \"profession.\" These days the Net, which has
already re-made such everyday pastimes as buying books and sending mail,
is reshaping Donovan\'s vocation as well.

Friedman relies on a lean staff of 20 m Austin. Several of his staff
members have military-intelligence backgrounds. He sees the firm\'s
outsider status as the key to its success. Straitford\'s briefs don\'t
sound like the usual Washington back-and-forthing, whereby agencies
avoid dramatic declarations on the chance they might be wrong.
Straitford, says Friedman, takes pride in its independent voice.

Scientists must communicate their message to the public in a
compassionate, understandable way-in human terms, not in the language of
molecular biology. We need to make clear the connection between animal
research and a grandmother\'s hip replacement, a father\'s bypass
operation, a baby\'s vaccinations, and even a pet\'s shots. To those who
are unaware that animal research was needed to produce these treatments,
as well as new treatments and vaccines, animal research seems wasteful
at best and cruel at worst.

Supporters of the new s~~u~~persystems argue that these mergers will
allow for s~~u~~bstantial cost

![](media/image50.jpeg){width="7.999890638670167e-2in"
height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}reductions and better coordinated
service. Any threat of monopoly, they argue, is removed by fierce

competition from trucks. But many shippers complain that for hea~~vy~~
bulk commodities traveling long

distances, such as coal, chemicals, and grain, trucking is too costly
and the railroads therefore ha~~v~~e

The vast consolidation within the rail industry means that most shippers
are served by only one

rail company. Railroads typically charge such \" captive \" shippers 20
to 30 percent more than they do

when another railroad is competing for the business. Shippers ~~w~~ho
feel they are being overcharged

Many captive shippers also worry they will soon be hit with a ro~~u~~nd
of h~~u~~ge rate increases. The

railroad industry as a whole, despite its bri~~g~~htening fortuning

It is said th~~a~~t in England de~~a~~th is pressing, in C~~an~~ada
inevit~~a~~ble and in California optional. Small

wonder. Americans\' life e~~x~~pectancy has nearly do~~u~~bled over the
past century. Failing hips can be

replaced, clinical depression controlled, cataracts removed in a
30-minute surgical procedure. Such

advances offer the aging population a quality of life that was

Death is normal; we ~~ar~~e genetically programmed to disintegrate and
perish, even under ideal

conditions. We all ~~u~~nderstand that at some level, yet as medical
consumers we treat death as a problem

third-p~~a~~rty payers from the cost of our c~~ar~~e, we demand
everything that can

possibly be done for us, even if it\'s useless. The most obvious example
is late-stage cancer care.

In 1950, the US spent \$12.7 billion on health care. In 2002, the cost
will be \$1,540 billion.

Many theories concerning the causes of juvenile delinquency (crimes

as the major contributing influence. Theories [l]{.underline} on the
individual suggest that children engage in criminal behavior 2 they were
not sufficiently penalized for previous misdeeds or that they have
learned criminal behavior through [3]{.underline} with others. Theories
focusing on the role of society suggest that children commit crimes in

Some sites design their agents to tempt job hunters to return. When
CareerSite\'s agent sends out messages to those who have signed up for
its service, for example, it includes only three potential jobs-those it
considers the best matches. There maybe more matches in the database;
job hunters will have to visit the site again to find them-and they do.
\"On the day after we send our messages, we see a sharp increase in our
traffic,\" says Seth Peets, vicepresident of marketing for CareerSite.

The human nose is an underrated tool. Humans are often thought to be
insensitive smellers compared with animals, [l]{.underline} this is
largely because, Lanimals,we stand upright. This means that our noses
are [3]{.underline} to perceiving those smells which float through the
air,\_±\_the majority of smells which stick to surfaces. In fact,
[5]{.underline} ,we are extremely sensitive to smells, [6]{.underline}
we do not generally realize it. Our noses are capable of\_\]\_human
smells even when these are\--8_to far below one part in one million.

Strangely, some people find that they can smell one type of flower but
not another[, 9]{.underline} others are sensitive to the smells of both
flowers. This may be because some people do not have the genes necessary
to generate_lQ\_ smell receptors in the nose. These receptors are the
cells which sense smells and send ll\_\_ to the brain. However,it has
been found that even people insensitive to a certain smell_l2.\_ can
suddenly become sensitive to it when_11_to it often enough.

height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}In the world of capuchins grapes are
luxury goods (and much preferable to cucumbers). So when one monkey was
handed a grape in exchange for her token, the second was reluctant to
h~~an~~d hers over for a mere piece of cucumber. And if one received a
grape without having to provide her token in exchange at all, the other
either tossed her own token at the researcher or out of the chamber, or
refused to accept the slice of cucumber. Indeed, the mere presence of a
grape in the other chamber (without an actual monkey to eat it) was

To serve as responsible stewards of the planet,we must press forward on
deeper atmospheric and oceanic research. But research alone is
inadequate. If the Administration won\'t take the legislative
initiative,Congress should help to begin fashioning conservation
measures. A bill by Democratic Senator Robert Byrd of West
Virginia,which would offer financial incentives for private industry,is
a promising start. Many see that the country is getting ready to build
lots of new power plants to meet our energy needs. If we are ever going
to protect the atmosphere,it is crucial that those new plants be
environmentally sound.

and dead

people speak. A ce~~ntur~~y ago, Freud formulated his revolutionary
theory that dreams

> were the disguised shadows of our unconscious desires and fears; by
> the late 1970s, neurologists had switched to thinking of them as just
> \"mental noise\" - the random

byproducts of the neural-repair work that goes on during sleep. Now
researchers

suspect that dreams are part of the mind\'s emotional thermostat,
regulating moods while the brain is \"off-line.\" And one leading
authority says that these intensely powerful mental events can be not
only harnessed but actually brought under

![](media/image35.jpeg){width="7.999890638670167e-2in"
height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}conscious control, to help us sleep and
feel better. \"It\'s your dream,\" says Rosalind

> C~~a~~rtwri~~g~~ht, chair of psychology at Chicago\'s Medical Center.
> \"If you don\'t like it,
>
> change it.\"

Evidence from brain imaging supports this vi~~e~~w. The brain is as
active during

REM (rapid eye movement) sleep - when most vivid dreams occur - as it is
when

![](media/image43.jpeg){width="6.833442694663167e-2in"
height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}fully awake, says Dr. Eric Nofzinger at
the University of Pittsburgh. But not all parts

![](media/image171.jpeg){width="1.1665573053368329e-2in"
height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}of the brain are equally involved; the
limbic system (the \"emotional brain\") is

> especially active, while the prefrontal cortex (the ce~~n~~ter of
> intellect ~~an~~d reasoning) is relatively quiet. \"We wake up from
> dreams happy or depressed, and those feelings can stay with us all
> day.\" says Stanford sleep researcher Dr. William Dement.

The link between dreams and emotions shows up among the patients in
C~~a~~rtwright\'s clinic. Most people seem to have more bad dreams early
in the night, progressing tow~~ard hap~~pier ones before awakening,
suggesting that they are working through negative feelings generated
during the day. Because our conscious mind is occupied with daily life
we don\'t always think about the emotional significance of the day\'s
eve~~n~~ts- u~~n~~til, it appears, we begin to dream.

At the end of the day, there\'s probably little reason to pay attention
to our dreams

height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}Terrorism, economic uncertainties and
general feelings of insecurity have increased

people\'s anxiety. Those suffering from persistent nightmares should
seek help from a therapist. For the rest of us, the brain has its ways
of working through bad feelings.

Premiers love to quote Mr. Romanow\'s report selectively, especially the

The townsfolk don\'t see it this way and the local council does not
contribute directly to the subsidy of the Royal Shakespeare Company.
[Stratford cries poor traditionally]{.underline}. Nevertheless every
hotel in town seems to be adding a new wing or cocktail lounge. Hilton
is building its own hotel there, which you may be sure will be decorated
with Hamlet Hamburger Bars, the Lear Lounge, the Banquo Banqueting Room,
and so forth, and will be very expensive.

That the seas ~~ar~~e being overfished has been known for years. What
researchers such as Ransom Myers ~~an~~d Boris Worm have shown is just
how fast things are changing. They h~~a~~ve looked at half a century of
data from fisheries around the world. Their methods do not attempt to
estimate the actual biomass (the amount of living biological matter) of
fish species in particular parts of the ocean, but rather changes in
that biomass over time. According to their latest paper published in
Nature, the biomass of large predators (~~an~~imals that kill and eat
other animals) in a new fishery is reduced on average by 80% within 15
years of the start of exploitation. In some long- fished areas, it has
halved again since then.

31\. The extinction of large prehistoric animals is noted to suggest
that

32\. We can infer from Dr. Myers and Dr. Worm\'s paper that

\[D\] the number of l~~ar~~ge predators dropped faster in new fisheries

Today the messages the average Westerner is surrounded with are not
religious but commercial, and forever happy. Fast-food eaters, news
anchors, text messengers, all smiling, smiling, smiling. Our magazines
feature beaming celebrities and happy families in perfect homes. And
since these messages have an agenda - to lure us to open our wallets -
they make the very idea of happiness seem unreliable.\"Celebrate!\"

First, the object of o~~u~~r study pleads for definition. What is an
intellectual? (46) \_I ·[shall define him as an individual who has
elected as his primary duty and]{.underline} [pleasure in life the
activity of thinking in a Socratic( in, 格 拉\[ij;) way about
moral]{.underline} [problems.]{.underline} He e~~x~~plores such problems
consciously, articulately, and frankly, first by asking factual
questions, then by asking moral questions, finally by suggesting action

> function is analogous to that of a judge, who must accept
> the]{.underline} [obligation of revealing in as obvious a manner as
> possible the course of reasoning]{.underline} [which led him to his
> decision]{.underline}.

This definition excludes many individuals usually referred to as
intellectuals - the average scientist, for one. (48) [I have excluded
him because, ~~w~~hile]{.underline} [his accomplishments may contribute
to the solution of moral problems, he has not]{.underline} [been
ch~~ar~~ged with the task of approaching any but the factual aspects of
those]{.underline} [problems]{.underline}. Like other human beings, he
encounters moral issues even in the everyday

> performance of his routine duties - he is not supposed to cook his
> experiments, manufacture evidence, or doctor his reports. (49) [But
> his primary task is not to think]{.underline} [about the moral code
> which governs his activity, any more than a businessman
> is]{.underline} [expected to dedicate his energies to an exploration
> of rules of cond~~u~~ct in business]{.underline}. During most of his
> waking life he will take his code for granted, as the businessman
> takes his ethics.

The definition also excludes the majority of teachers, despite the fact
that

Read the following text. Choose the best word(s) for each numbered blank
and mark A, B, C or D on ANSWER SHEET 1. (10 points)

By 1830 the former Spanish and Portuguese colonies had become
independent nations. The roughly 20 million [1]{.underline} of these
nations looked [2]{.underline} to the future. Born in the crisis of the
old regime and Iberian colonialism, many of the leaders of independence
[3]{.underline} the ideals of representative government, careers
[4]{.underline} to talent, freedom of commerce and trade, the
[5]{.underline} to private property, and a belief in the individual as
the basis of society. [6]{.underline} there was a belief that the new
nations should be sovereign and independent states, large enough to be
economically viable and integrated by a [7]{.underline} set of laws.

On the issue of [8]{.underline} of religion and the position of the
Church, [9]{.underline} , there was less agreement [10]{.underline} the
leadership. Roman Catholicism had been the state religion and the only
on[e 11]{.underline} by the Spanish crown. [12]{.underline} most leaders
sought to maintain Catholicism [13]{.underline} the official religion of
the new states, some sought to end the [14]{.underline} of other faiths.
The defense of the Church became a rallying [15]{.underline} for the
conservative forces.

The ideals of the early leaders of independence were often egalitarian,
valuing equality of everything. Bolivar had received aid from Haiti and
had [16]{.underline} in return to abolish slavery in the areas he
liberated. By 1854 slavery had been abolished everywhere except Spain' s
[17]{.underline} colonies. Early promises to end Indian tribute and
taxes on people of mixed origin came much [18]{.underline} because the
new nations still needed the revenue such policies [19]{.underline} .
Egalitarian sentiments were often tempered by fears that the mass of the
population was [20]{.underline} self-rule and democracy.

If you were to examine the birth certificates of every soccer player in
2006's World Cup tournament, you would most likely find a noteworthy
quirk: elite soccer players are more likely to have been born in the
earlier months of the year than in the later months. If you then
examined the European national youth teams that feed the World Cup and
professional ranks, you would find this strange phenomenon to be even
more pronounced.

Ericsson and his colleagues have thus taken to studying expert
performers in a wide range of pursuits, including soccer. They gather
all the data they can, not just performance statistics and biographical
details but also the results of their own laboratory experiments with
high achievers. Their work makes a rather startling assertion: the trait
we commonly call talent is highly overrated. Or, put another way, expert
performers -- whether in memory or surgery, ballet or computer
programming-- are nearly always made, not born.

For the past several years, the Sunday newspaper supplement *Parade* has
featured a column called "Ask Marilyn." People are invited to query
Marilyn vos Savant, who at age 10 had tested at a mental level of
someone about 23 years old; that gave her an IQ of 228 -- the highest
score ever recorded. IQ tests ask you to complete verbal and visual
analogies, to envision paper after it has been folded and cut, and to
deduce numerical sequences, among other similar tasks. So it is a bit
confusing when vos Savant fields such queries from the average Joe
(whose IQ is 100) as, What's the difference between love and fondness?
Or what is the nature of luck and coincidence? It' s not obvious how the
capacity to visualize objects and to figure out numerical patterns suits
one to answer questions that have eluded some of the best poets and
philosophers.

> what does it mean to be smart? How much of intelligence can be

> genetics, computer science and other fields?

The defining term of intelligence in humans still seems to be the IQ
score, even though IQ tests are not given as often as they used to be.
The test comes primarily in two forms: the Stanford-Binet Intelligence
Scale and the Wechsler Intelligence Scales (both come in adult and
children' s version). Generally costing several hundred dollars, they
are usually given only by psychologists, although variations of them
populate bookstores and the World Wide Web. Superhigh scores like vos
Savant' s are no longer possible, because scoring is now based on a
statistical population distribution among age peers, rather than simply
dividing the mental age by the chronological age and multiplying by 100.
Other standardized tests, such as the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT)
and the Graduate Record Exam (GRE), capture the main aspects of IQ
tests.

In just one generation, millions of mothers have gone to work,
transforming basic family economics. Scholars, policymakers, and critics
of all stripes have debated the social implications of these changes,
but few have looked at the side effect: family risk has risen as well.
Today' s families have budgeted to the limits of their new two-paycheck
status. As a result, they have lost the parachute they once had in times
of financial setback -- a back-up earner (usually Mom) who could go into
the workforce if the primary earner got laid off or fell sick. This
"added-worker effect" could support the safety net offered by
unemployment insurance or disability insurance to help families weather
bad times. But today, a disruption to family fortunes can no longer be
made up with extra income from an otherwise-stay-at-home partner.

During the same period, families have been asked to absorb much more
risk in their retirement income. Steelworkers, airline employees, and
now those in the auto industry are joining millions of families who must
worry about interest rates, stock market fluctuation, and the harsh
reality that they may outlive their retirement money. For much of the
past year, President Bush campaigned to move Social Security to a
savings-account model, with retirees trading much or all of their
guaranteed payments for payments depending on investment returns. For
younger families, the picture is not any better. Both the absolute cost
of healthcare and the share of it borne by families have risen -- and
newly fashionable health-savings plans are spreading from legislative
halls to Wal-Mart workers, with much higher deductibles and a large new
dose of investment risk for families' future healthcare. Even
demographics are working against the middle class family, as the odds of
having a weak elderly parent-- and all the attendant need for physical
and financial assistance -- have jumped eightfold in just one
generation.

"Data is becoming an asset which needs to be guarded as much as any
other asset," says Haim Mendelson of Stanford University' s business
school. "The ability to guard customer data is the key to market value,
which the board is responsible for on behalf of shareholders" . Indeed,
just as there is the concept of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(GAAP), perhaps it is time for GASP, Generally Accepted Security
Practices, suggested Eli Noam of New York' s Columbia Business School.
"Setting the proper investment level for security, redundancy, and
recovery is a management issue, not a technical one," he says.

Teachers are responsible for teaching kids how to learn; parents should
be responsible for teaching them how to work. Assign responsibilities
around the house and make sure homework deadlines are met. Encourage
teenagers to take a part-time job. Kids need plenty of practice delaying

managing time and setting priorities.

Furthermore, the legal system and the events which occur within it are

Most tests require collecting cells by swabbing saliva in the mouth and
sending it

But some observers are skeptical. \"There\'s a kind of false precision
being hawked by people claiming they are doing ancestry testing,\" says
Troy Duster, a New York University sociologist. He notes that each
individual has many ancestors - numbering in the hundreds just a few
centuries back. Yet most ancestry testing only considers a single
lineage, either the Y chromosome inherited through men in a father\'s
line or mitochondrial DNA, which is passed down only from mothers. This
DNA can reveal genetic information about only one or two ancestors, even
though, for example, just three generations back people also have six
other great-grandparents or, four generations back, 14 other
great-great-grandparents.

What is the real relationship between education and economic
development? We have to suspect that continuing economic growth promotes
the development of education even when governments don\'t force it.
After all, that\'s how education got started. When our ancestors were
hunters and gatherers 10, 000 years ago, they didn\'t have time to
wonder much about anything besides finding food. Only when hum~~an~~ity
began to get its food in a more productive way was there time for other
things.

Boas felt that the culture of any society must be understood as the
result of a unique history and not as one of many cultures belonging to
a broader evolution~~ar~~y stage or type of culture. (44)

Also in the early 1900s, French sociologist Emile Durkheim developed a
theory of culture that would greatly influence anthropology. Durkheim
proposed that religious beliefs functioned to reinforce social
solidarity. An interest in the relationship between the function of
society and culture became a major theme in European, and especially
British, anthropology.

There is a marked difference between the education which every one gets
from living with others and the deliberate educating of the young. In
the former case the education is incidental; it is natural and
important, but it is not the express reason of the association. (46) [It
may be said that the measure of the worth of any social]{.underline}
[institution is its effect in enlarging and improving experience, but
this effect is not a]{.underline} [part of its original
motive]{.underline}. Religious associations began, for example, in the
desire to secure the favor of overruling powers and to ward off evil
influences; family life in the desire to gratify appetites and secure
family perpetuity; systematic labor, for the most part, because of
enslavement to others, etc. (47) [Only gradually was the]{.underline}
QY:­ [product of the institution noted, and only more gradually still was
this effect]{.underline} [considered as a directive factor in the
conduct of the institution]{.underline}. Even today, in our industrial
life, apart from certain values of industriousness and thrift, the
intellectual and emotional reaction of the forms of human association
under which the world\' s work is carried on receives little attention
as compared with physical output.

> But in dealing with the young, the fact of association itself as an
> immediate

human fact, gains in importance. (48) [While it is easy to ignore in our
contact with]{.underline} [them the effect of our acts upon their
disposition, it is not so easy as in dealing with]{.underline}
[adults]{.underline}. The need of training is too evident and the
pressure to accomplish a change in their attitude and habits is too
urgent to leave these consequences wholly out of account. (49) [Since
our chief business with them is to enable them to share in
a]{.underline} [common life we cannot help considering whether or not we
are forming the powers]{.underline} [which will secure this
ability]{.underline}. If humanity has made some headway in realizing
that the ultimate value of every institution is its distinctively human
effect we may well believe that this lesson has been learned largely
through dealings with theyoung.
