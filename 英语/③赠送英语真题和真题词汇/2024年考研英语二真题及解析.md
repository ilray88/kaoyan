>**Text 1**
>Anger over AI\'s role in exacerbating inequality could endanger thetechnology\'s future.In her new book Cogsand Monsters:What EconomicsIs,and What It Should Be,Diane Coyle,an economist at CambridgeUniversity,argues that the digital economy requires new ways ofthinking about progress."Whatever we mean by the economy growing,bythings getting better, the gains will have to be more evenly sharedthan in the recent past,\"she writes."An economy of tech millionairesor billionaires and gig workers,with middle-income jobs undercut byautomation, will notbe politicallysustainable."
>Improving living standards and increasing prosperity for morepeoplewill require greater use of digital technologies to boost productivityin various sectors,including health care and construction,saysCoyle.But people can\'t be expected to embrace the changes if they\'renot seeingthe benefits---if they\'rejust seeing good jobs beingdestroyed.
>In a recent interview with MIT Technology Review,Coyle said she fearsthat tech\'s inequality problem could bea roadblock to deployingAI."We\'re talking about disruption,"she says."These aretransformative technologies that change the ways we spend our timeevery day, that change business models that succeed."To make such"tremendous changes,"she adds,you need social buy-in.
>Instead,says Coyle,resentment is simmeringamong many as the benefitsare perceived to go to elites ina handful of prosperous cities.
>Acording to the Brookings Institution,a short list of eight Americancities that included San Francisco,San Jose,Boston,and Seattle hadroughly 38%ofall tech jobs by 2019.New AI technologies areparticularly concentrated:Brookings\'s Mark Muro and Sifan Liuestimate that just 15 cities account for two-thirds of theAI assetsand capabilities in the United States (San Francisco and San Josealone account for about one-quarter).
>The dominance of a few cities in the invention and commercializationof AI means that geographical disparities in wealth will continue tosoar.Not only will this foster political and

>remains the second-largest net importer of timber in the world.
>Coming at a time of fresh incentives from the UK government forlandowners to grow more trees,the trade body says these don\'t go farenough and fail to promote the benefits of planting them to boosttimber supplies."Not only are we facing a carbon crisis now,but wewill also be facing a future construction crisis because offailure toplant trees to produce wood."said Stuart Goodall,chief executive ofConfor.\"For decadeswe have not taken responsibility for investing inour domestic wood supply,leaving us exposed to fluctuating prices andfighting for future supplies of wood as global demandrisesand our ownsupplies fall.\"
>The UK has ideal conditions for growing wood to build low-carbon homesand is a global leader in certifying that its forests are sustainablymanaged,Confor says.While around three quarters of Scottish homes arebuilt from Scottish timber,the useof home-grown wood inEngland is onlyaround 25 percent.
>While productive tree planting can deliver real financial benefits torural economies and contribute to theUK\'s net-zero strategy,the focusof government supportcontinues to be on food production andtherewinding and planting of native woodland solely forbiodiversity.Goodall add "While food production and biodiversity areclearlyof critical importance,we need our land to also providesecuresupplies of wood for construction,manufacturing and contributeto netzero.

>One big challenge in keeping unsafe aging drivers off the road isconvincing them that it is time to tum over the key.It is a completelife-changer when someone stops---or is forced to stop---driving,saidformer risk manager Anne M.Menke.
>TheAmerican Medical Association advises physicians that in situationwhere clear evidence of substantial driving impairment implies astrong threat to patient and publicsafety,and where the physician\'sadvice to discontinue driving privileges is ignored,it is desirableand ethical to notify the Department of Motor Vehicles,Menkewrote.\"Some states require physiciansto report, others allow butdonot mandate reports,while a few consider a report breach ofconfidentiality. There could be liability and penalties if a physiciandoes not act in accordance with state laws on reporting andconfidentiality"she counseled
>Part of the problem in keeping older drivers safe is that thedifficulties are addressed piecemeal by different professionswithdifferent focuses,including gerontologists,highway administrationofficials,automotive engineers and others,said gerontologist ElizabethDugan. "There\'s not a National Institute of Older DriverStudies,\"she said."We need better evidence on what makes driversunsafe\"and whatcan help,said Dugan
>One thing that does seem to work is requiring drivers to report inperson for license renewal. Mandatory in-personrenewal was associatedwith a31 percent reduction in fatal crashes involving drivers 85 orolder,according to one study.Passing vision tests also produced asimilar decline in fatal crashes for those drivers,although thereappeared to be nobenefit from combining the two
>Many old divers don\'t see eye doctors or can\'t afford to.Primarycareproviders have their hands full and may notbe able to follow throughwith patients who have trouble driving because they can\'t tumtheirheads or remember where they are going---or have gotten shorterand havent changed their seat settings sufficiently to reach carpedals easily,
>As long as there are other cars on the roads,self-driving cars won\'tsolve the problems of crashes,said Dugan.Avoiding dangers posed by allthose human drivers would require to many algorithms,she said.But weneed to do more to improve safety,said Dugan."If we\'re going to have100-year lives,we needcars that a 90-year-old can drive comfortably."

>If you look at the apps on your phone,chances are you have at leastone related to your health---and probably several.Whether it is amental health app,a fitness tracker,a connected health device orsomething else,many of us are taking advantage of this technologytokeep better track of our health in some shape or form.Recentresearch from the Organization for the Review ofCare and HealthApplications found that 350,000 health apps were availableon themarket 90,000 of which launched in 2020 alone.
>While these apps have a great deal to offer,it is not always clear howthe personal information we input is collected,safeguarded and sharedonline.Existing health privacy law, such as the Health InsurancePortability and Accountability Act,is primarily focused on the wayhospitals,doctors\'offices,clinics and insurance companies storehealth records online. The health information these apps and healthdata tracking wearables are collecting typically does not receive thesame legalprotections.

Section 5 of the FTC Act empowers theFTC to iniiate enforcement actionagainst unfair or deceptive acts,meaning the FTCcan only act after thefact if a company\'s privacy practices are misleading or causeunjustified consumer harm.While the FTC is doing what it can to ensureapps are keeping their promises to consumers around the handling oftheir sensitive health information, the rate at which these healthapps are hitting the market demonstrates just how immense of achallenge this is.

>Sue Rexford,the director of college guidance at the Charles.E.SmithJewish Day School, says it is not necessary for a student,fllingoutthe Common Application to list 10 activities in the application
>"No"college will expect that a student has a huge laundry list ofextracurricular that they have been passionately involvedin each foran tended period oftime,\"Rexford wrote in an email.
