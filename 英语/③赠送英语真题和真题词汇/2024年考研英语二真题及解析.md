  **Section II Reading Comprehension**   **Part A**   **Directions:**   Read the following four texts.Answer the questions after each text by  choosing A,B,C or D. Mark your answers on the ANSWER SHEET.(40 points)   **Text 1**   Anger over AI\'s role in exacerbating inequality could endanger the  technology\'s future.In her new book Cogsand Monsters:What Economics  Is,and What It Should Be,Diane Coyle,an economist at Cambridge  University,argues that the digital economy requires new ways of  thinking about progress."Whatever we mean by the economy growing,by  things getting better, the gains will have to be more evenly shared  than in the recent past,\"she writes."An economy of tech millionaires  or billionaires and gig workers,with middle-income jobs undercut by  automation, will notbe politicallysustainable."   Improving living standards and increasing prosperity for morepeople  will require greater use of digital technologies to boost productivity  in various sectors,including health care and construction,says  Coyle.But people can\'t be expected to embrace the changes if they\'re  not seeingthe benefits---if they\'rejust seeing good jobs being  destroyed.   In a recent interview with MIT Technology Review,Coyle said she fears  that tech\'s inequality problem could bea roadblock to deploying  AI."We\'re talking about disruption,"she says."These are  transformative technologies that change the ways we spend our time  every day, that change business models that succeed."To make such  "tremendous changes,"she adds,you need social buy-in.   Instead,says Coyle,resentment is simmeringamong many as the benefits  are perceived to go to elites ina handful of prosperous cities.   Acording to the Brookings Institution,a short list of eight American  cities that included San Francisco,San Jose,Boston,and Seattle had  roughly 38%ofall tech jobs by 2019.New AI technologies are  particularly concentrated:Brookings\'s Mark Muro and Sifan Liu  estimate that just 15 cities account for two-thirds of theAI assets  and capabilities in the United States (San Francisco and San Jose  alone account for about one-quarter).   The dominance of a few cities in the invention and commercialization  of AI means that geographical disparities in wealth will continue to  soar.Not only will this foster political and

  social unrest,but it could,as Coyle suggests,hold back the sorts ofAI  technologies needed for   regional economies to grow.   Part of the solutioncould lie in somehow loosening the stranglehold  that Big Tech has on defining the AI agenda.That will likely take  increased federal funding for research independent of the tech  giants.Muroand others have suggested hefty federal funding to help  create US regional innovation centers,for example.   A more immediate response is to broaden our digital imaginations to  conceive of AI technologies that don\'t simply replacejobs but expand  opportunities in the sectors that different partsof the country care  most about,like health care,education,and manufacturing.   21.Coyle argues in her new book that economic growth should   \[A\]giverise toinnovation \[B\]diversifycareerchoices   \[C\]benefit people equally   D\]be promoted forcefully   22.According to paragraph 2,digital technology should be useful to  \[A\]bring about instant prosperity   \[B\]reduce people\'s workload   \[C\]raise overall work efficiency   D\]enhance cross-sector coopertion   23.What does Coyle fear about transformative technology?   \[A\]They may affect work-life balance. \[B\]They may be impracticalto  deploy. \[C\]They may incurhuge expenditure.   D\]They may be unwelcome to the public   24.Several American cities are mentioned to show   \[A\]the uneven distribution of AI technologies in the US   \[B\]the disappointing prospect of tech jobs in the US \[C\]the fast  progress of US regional economies   \[D\]the increasing significance of US AI assets   25.With regard to Coyle concern,the author suggests   \[A\]raisingfiunds to start new AI projects   \[B\]encouraging collaboration in AI research \[C\]guarding against  the sideeffects of AI   \[D\]redefining the role of AItechnologies   **Text 2**   The UK is facing a future construction crisis because of a failure to  plant trees to produce wood,Conforhas wamed.The forestryand wood trade  body has called for urgent action to reduce the country\'s reliance on  timber imports and provide a stable supply of wood for future

  generations.Curently only 20 percent of the UK\'s wood requirement is  home-grown while it   remains the second-largest net importer of timber in the world.   Coming at a time of fresh incentives from the UK government for  landowners to grow more trees,the trade body says these don\'t go far  enough and fail to promote the benefits of planting them to boost  timber supplies."Not only are we facing a carbon crisis now,but we  will also be facing a future construction crisis because offailure to  plant trees to produce wood."said Stuart Goodall,chief executive of  Confor.\"For decadeswe have not taken responsibility for investing in  our domestic wood supply,leaving us exposed to fluctuating prices and  fighting for future supplies of wood as global demandrisesand our own  supplies fall.\"   The UK has ideal conditions for growing wood to build low-carbon homes  and is a global leader in certifying that its forests are sustainably  managed,Confor says.While around three quarters of Scottish homes are  built from Scottish timber,the useof home-grown wood inEngland is only  around 25 percent.   While productive tree planting can deliver real financial benefits to  rural economies and contribute to theUK\'s net-zero strategy,the focus  of government supportcontinues to be on food production andthe  rewinding and planting of native woodland solely for  biodiversity.Goodall add "While food production and biodiversity are  clearlyof critical importance,we need our land to also providesecure  supplies of wood for construction,manufacturing and contributeto net  zero.   "While the UK government has stated its ambition for more tree  planting,there has been little action on the ground.\"Confor is now  calling for much greater impetus behind those aspirationsto ensure  wehaveenoughwood to meet increasing demand.\"   26.It can be leamed from paragraphI that the UK needs to   \[A\]increase its domestic wood supply   \[B\]reduce its demand for timber   \[C\]lower its wood production costs \[D\]lift its control on timber  imports   27.According to Confor,the UK govemment\'s fresh incentives   \[A\]can hardly address construction crisis   \[B\]are believed to come at the wrong time \[C\]seem to be misleading  for landowners \[D\]willbe costly to put into practice   28.The UK\'s exposure to fluctuational woodprices is a result of  \[A\]government\'s inaction on timber imports   \[B\]inadequate investment in growing wood   \[C\]competition of timber traders at home   \[D\]wood products motiveto maximise profits   29.Whichof the following causes the shortage of wood supply in UK?   \[A\]excessive timber consumption in construction \[B\]unfavorable  conditions for growing trees   \[C\]outdated technology for wood production

TheAmerican Medical Association advises physicians that in situation  where clear evidence of substantial driving impairment implies a  strong threat to patient and publicsafety,and where the physician\'s  advice to discontinue driving privileges is ignored,it is desirable  and ethical to notify the Department of Motor Vehicles,Menke  wrote.\"Some states require physiciansto report, others allow but  donot mandate reports,while a few consider a report breach of  confidentiality. There could be liability and penalties if a physician  does not act in accordance with state laws on reporting and  confidentiality"she counseled   Part of the problem in keeping older drivers safe is that the  difficulties are addressed piecemeal by different professions  withdifferent focuses,including gerontologists,highway administration  officials,automotive engineers and others,said gerontologist Elizabeth  Dugan. "There\'s not a National Institute of Older Driver  Studies,\"she said."We need better evidence on what makes drivers  unsafe\"and whatcan help,said Dugan   One thing that does seem to work is requiring drivers to report in  person for license renewal. Mandatory in-personrenewal was associated  with a31 percent reduction in fatal crashes involving drivers 85 or  older,according to one study.Passing vision tests also produced a  similar decline in fatal crashes for those drivers,although there  appeared to be nobenefit from combining the two   Many old divers don\'t see eye doctors or can\'t afford to.Primarycare  providers have their hands full and may notbe able to follow through  with patients who have trouble driving because they can\'t tum  theirheads or remember where they are going---or have gotten shorter  and havent changed their seat settings sufficiently to reach car  pedals easily,   As long as there are other cars on the roads,self-driving cars won\'t  solve the problems of crashes,said Dugan.Avoiding dangers posed by all  those human drivers would require to many algorithms,she said.But we  need to do more to improve safety,said Dugan."If we\'re going to have  100-year lives,we needcars that a 90-year-old can drive comfortably."   31.According toParagraphl,keeping unsafe aging drivers off the road   \[A\]is a new safety measure   \[B\]has become a disputed issue   \[C\]canbe a toughtask to complete   \[D\]will be beneficial to their health   32.The American medical associations advice

While these apps have a great deal to offer,it is not always clear how  the personal information we input is collected,safeguarded and shared  online.Existing health privacy law, such as the Health Insurance  Portability and Accountability Act,is primarily focused on the way  hospitals,doctors\'offices,clinics and insurance companies store  health records online. The health information these apps and health  data tracking wearables are collecting typically does not receive the  same legalprotections.   Without additional protections in place,companies may share (and  potentially   monetize)personal health information in a way consumersmay not have  authorized or anticipated. In2021,Flo Health faced a Federal Trade  Commission(FTC)investigation.The FTC allegedin a complaint that  \"despite express privacy caims,the company took control of users  sensitivity fertility data and shared it with third parties.\"Flo  Health and the FTC setled the matter   with a Consent Order requiring the company to get app users\'express  affirmative consent before sharing their health information as well as  to instruct the third parties to delete the data they had obtained.

  Section 5 of the FTC Act empowers theFTC to iniiate enforcement action  against unfair or deceptive acts,meaning the FTCcan only act after the  fact if a company\'s privacy practices are misleading or cause  unjustified consumer harm.While the FTC is doing what it can to ensure  apps are keeping their promises to consumers around the handling of  their sensitive health information, the rate at which these health  apps are hitting the market demonstrates just how immense of a  challenge this is.   As to the prospects for federal legislation,commentators suggest  thatcomprehensive federal privacy legislation seemsunlikely in the  short term.States have begun implementing their own solutions to shore  up protections for consumer-generated health data.Califomia has been  at the forefront of state privacy efforts with the Califomia Consumer  Privacy Act of 2018.Virginia, Colorado and Utah have also recently  passed state consumerdataprivacy legislation   36.The research findings are cited in Paragraph l to show   \[A\]the prevalence of health apps   \[B\]the public concen over health \[C\]the popularity of smartphones  \[D\]the advancement of technology   37.What dose the author imply about existinghealth privacy law?   \[A\]Its coverage needs to be extended.   \[B\]Its enforcement needs strengthening.   \[C\]It has discouraged medical misconduct. \[D\]It has disappointed  insurance companies   38.Before sharing its users\'health information,FloHealth is required  to   \[A\]seek the approval of the FTC   \[B\]find qualified third parties   \[C\]remove irrelevant personal data   D\]obtain their explicit permission   39.What challenges is the FTC currently faced with? \[A\]Thecomplexity  of health information.   \[B\]The rapid increase in new health apps.   \[C\]The subtle deceptiveness of health apps.   \[D\]The difficulty in assessingconsumerharm   40.It can be leamed from the last paragraph that health data  protection   \[A\]has been embraced byhealth app developers \[B\]has been a focus  of federal policy-making   \[C\]hasencounteredopposition in Califomia   D\]has gained legislative support in some states   **Part B**   **Directions:**

  Read the following text and choose the best answer from the right  column to complete each of the unfinished statements in the left  column.Mark your answers on the ANSWER SHEET.(10 points)   High school students eager to stand out in the college application  processoften participate in a litany of extracurricular activities  hoping to bolster their chances of admission a selective undergraduate  institution.   However,college admissions experts say that the quality of a college  hopeful\'s extracurricular activities matter more than the number of  activities he or she participates in   Sue Rexford,the director of college guidance at the Charles.E.Smith  Jewish Day School, says it is not necessary for a student,flling  outthe Common Application to list 10 activities in the application   "No"college will expect that a student has a huge laundry list of  extracurricular that they have been passionately involvedin each for  an tended period oftime,\"Rexford wrote in an email.   Experts say it is tougher to distinguish oneself in a  school-affiliated extracurricular activity that is common among high  school students than it is to stand out while doing an uncommon  activity.   "The competition to stand out and make an impact is going to be much  stiffer,and so if they\'re going to do a popular activity,I\'d say,be  the best at it."says Sara Harherson,a college admission consultant.   High school students who have an impressive personal project they are  working on independently often impress colleges,experts say.   "For example,a student withan interest in entrepreneurship could  demonstrate skills and potential by starting a profitable small  business."Olivia Valdes,the founder of Zen Admissions consulting  firm,wrote in an email.   Joseph Adegboyega-Edun,aMaryland High school guidance counselor,says  unconventional extracurricular activities can help students,impress  college admissionsoffices,assuming they demonstrated,serious  commitment."Again,sinceone of the big questions high school seniors  must consider is 'What makes you unique?"having an  uncommon,extracurricular activity,a conventional one is  anadvantage,\"he wrote in an email   Experts say demonstrating talent in at least one extracuricular  activity can help in the college admissionsprocess,especially at  top-tier undergraduate institutions.   "Distinguishing yourself in one focused type of extracurricular  activity can be a positive in the admissions process,especially for  highly selective institutions,where having top grades and test scores  is not enough,\"KatieKelley admissionscounselor at Ivy Wiseadmissions  consultancy, wrote in an email."Students need to have that quality or  hook that will appeal to admissions officers and allow them to  visualize how the student might come and enrich their campus  community."   Extracurricular activities related to the collegemajor declared on a  college application are beneficial,experts suggest."Ifyou already know  your major,having an extracurricular that fits into that majorcan be a  big plus,\"says Mayghin Levine,the manager of educational  opportunities with The Cabbage Patch Settlement House,a  Louisville,Kentucky,nonprofit community center.

  Dear Jack,   I am very glad tohave the chance to work with you on the survey of  protection of old   houses inAnren Town.AndIam writing to propose a plan   My plan includes the following two steps.The first one,I suppose,is  that we should get into contact with the local government to  inquireabout how many old houses have been preserved. With that figure  in mind,then,we can set upa specific period oftime to visit those  houses and learm about their conditions.When we getdonewith this,we  can move on to the next stage.   What do you think of my plan?Please feel free to contact me if you  have any other ideas. Looking forward to your reply.   Yours,   Li Ming   **Part B**   48 **.Directions**   Write an essay based on the chart blow.In your writing,you should   1)interpret the chart,and 2)give your comments.

  **参考范文：**   Given above is a bar chart,graphically comparing percentage  distributions of students\'gains made through practical courses in a  certain college.Strikingly,it can be observed thatmore than 90%of  college students acquire relevant knowledge by engaging in such  courses,with the improvement of practical skills,the enhancement of  cooperation and the boost in mood occupying   84.8%,54.4%and 32.6%,respectively   A number of factors can account for this situation,but listed below  might be the most critical ones.Firstly,one factor is that  undergraduates in mounting numbers,in the face of fierce competition  in the labor market,are more aware of the great necessity for them to  equip themselves with comprehensiveknowledge and skills for climbing  the upper ladder,which might not be taught inconventionally normal  classes,which,to a large extent,can fully justify the considerable  proportion of obtaining relevant knowledge and improving one\'s  practical

  skills.Another factor that cannot be ignored is that the mass  media,coupled with the schools themselves,may have launched  alarge-scale educational campaign to call on those living in ivory  towers to unleash their potential,take their own initiative,enhance  mutual cooperation and enjoy ease of mind.   Judging from what has been discussed above,a sound conclusion can be  safely drawn that active participation in outdoor practical courses  does benefit college students inmultiple ways. Accordingly,it is  strongly suggested,from my perspective,that universities and colleges  should provide more opportunities for these youngsters to improve  their comprehensive capacities, instead of leaving them in the  classroom obsessed with mechanical memorization.
